> One level below [01 - The Quality Cycle](01-the-quality-cycle.md). Defines the concrete artifact each PDCA beat produces, who writes it, and the handoff contract between beats. The through-line: Do and Check assemble one **result document** that ends in a Check sign-off (the per-contribution verdict); Act runs *across* completed cycles' result documents to identify process deltas. Extends the `results/issue_<id>/` bundle pattern with the Check-layer artifacts (gate report, advisory verdict) and adds a separate process-level Act log. Living document.

                         │
                         ▼
ACT   ── periodically, across N completed cycles, reads their
         bundles + each §10 Act-candidate hints, writes ──▶
         process/act-log.md  (process deltas: ruleset/template/
                              gates/skills adjusted)
                         │
                         ▼
              improved baseline → next PLAN
```

The per-contribution bundle ends at Check sign-off. Act is a separate, cross-cycle pass; it does not block the contribution from shipping or closing. The bundle is the durable record Act reads from later.

Each per-cycle file lives in `results/issue_<id>/`. The result document is `SUMMARY.md`; everything else is either its input or a ready-to-ship attachment it references. The Act log lives outside the per-issue bundle, at a project-level path (e.g. `process/act-log.md`), and cites the bundles it draws on.

---

## PLAN → `brief.md` (the contribution spec)

Authored by **you** (or a planning chat). It is the spec plus the marching orders, drawn from the *current* process baseline (templates, ruleset, branch-target rules) that Act maintains.

**The Plan artifact's shape scales with the work.** For a one-fix contribution (the common case), Plan writes one `brief.md` against the fields below. For a coordinated multi-part contribution — an architectural change, a phased migration, a design-proposal-shaped piece of work — Plan instead writes a **design proposal** (e.g. `design.md`, `GEPS-NNN.md`, an RFC) that *itself spawns N child briefs*. The design proposal has its own structure ([01 - The Quality Cycle](01-the-quality-cycle.md) §Solution-approach design: Goals/Non-goals, Decomposition into independently-landable parts, Phased migration with safe stall points, Objections and responses, Impact assessment, De-risking, Open questions, Future Work), and goes through its own review cycle before any child brief is authored. Each spawned child brief then follows the per-fix `brief.md` spec below.

Both shapes flow through the same downstream beats — Do, Check,
Act — without modification; only the Plan-side artifact differs.

**Required fields (one-fix `brief.md`):**

- **Spec — the defect and the success criterion.** What is wrong, and the observable condition that means it is fixed. This is the thing Check verifies against; if it is vague, Check cannot adjudicate.
- **Repo + branch target, resolved.** Decided here, not left to Do. (Resolve cross-repo ambiguity by reproducing if the traceback location is unclear.)
- **Onto branch** *(optional)*. `<remote>/<branch>` of an existing open PR's head. When set, the fix is a commit **stacked onto that PR** rather than a new PR: Check tests against that branch (`$PDCA_BASE`) and publish commits onto and pushes to it (issue #54). Use it for a series of fixes each contributing to one already-open PR.
- **Scope — one logical fix.** State it, and state what is explicitly out of scope, so Check can flag scope creep against a written boundary.
- **Repro instruction.** Which fixture, exact steps, on the target branch. Repro-or-close is the first action.
- **Test requirement.** Where the test ships and that it must fail pre-fix, pass post-fix.
- **Citations expected.** Do must cite path:line on the target branch for every claim and change.
- **STOP discipline.** Draft only until Check sign-off. Push and draft-PR-open MAY happen during the cycle (useful for CI feedback); MUST NOT mark ready before sign-off accepts.
- **Disposition hint, not verdict.** The Plan-time triage guess (POSSIBLY-FIXED → verify first; likely-fix; likely-close). Do/Check may override it with evidence.

---

## DO → `patch.diff` + the test + `build-notes.md`

Authored by the **builder** (e.g. Claude Code), production only — implement, nothing else.

- **`patch.diff`** — the change. MAY be committed and pushed to a feature/draft branch; MUST NOT be merged. A draft PR against the brief's branch target MAY be opened to let CI exercise the patch.
- **the test** — shipped in the same change, at the location the brief named.
- **`build-notes.md`** — the builder's rationale: why this change, what was tried, the reasoning. **This file is withheld from the Check reviewer** (see Independence contract). It exists for the human signing off Check, so the human can see the builder's account *beside* the independent verdict, never instead of it.

Do also drafts the spec restatement and disposition-claimed sections of `SUMMARY.md` (it knows what it set out to do); Check appends the evidence.

---

## CHECK (gates + reviewer) → `check-gates.{md,json}` + `check-review.md`

The CHECK beat has three components — **gates**, **reviewer**, and **sign-off** — covered in the next three sub-sections of this doc. The two artifacts gates and reviewer produce (this section), the **SUMMARY.md** result document the driver assembles from those artifacts plus the brief (next section), and the **sign-off** step that completes the beat (the section after that) together describe the full CHECK beat. All three components belong to *one* CHECK beat — not three separate beats. The correctness chain, conformance stack, and validation act ([01 - The Quality Cycle](01-the-quality-cycle.md) §5/5/1) run across all three components.

This first sub-section covers the gates and the reviewer — two oracles of different trust.

### `check-gates.{md,json}` — deterministic gates

Machine-decided, every row carries its oracle and a path:line.
Correctness chain + conformance Tiers 1–4:

| Check | Result | Oracle | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| repro (red pre-fix) | confirmed / not-repro | fixture on target branch | log / screenshot |
| verification (green post-fix) | pass / fail | the shipped test | log |
| regression | suite green / N broke | existing suite | junit |
| T1 structure | pass / fail | structure validator (rule IDs) | path:line |
| T2 shape | pass / fail | semgrep (rule IDs) | path:line |
| T3 runtime | pass / fail | find_spec / deps-absent run | log |
| T4 contribution | pass / fail | commit-msg hook / branch-target / version-bump | path:line |

A deterministic FAIL with auto-fixable cause (lint, format, genuinely-red test) may be auto-fixed and re-run; a deterministic FAIL that needs a decision stops and surfaces to NEEDS-HUMAN. A gate that genuinely *cannot run* its check (vs. running and failing) returns a third result, **`unverifiable`** — it does not fail `overall` but is routed to §6 NEEDS-HUMAN for the human to clear (see [04 - Validation Tooling](04-validation-tooling.md) §Gate result vocabulary and C5a/C6).

### `check-review.md` — advisory reviewer (decorrelated)

Produced by the **advisory reviewer** (different model family, e.g. Codex), from `{patch.diff, test, brief.md, check-gates}` **only** — never `build-notes.md`. Covers the judgment cells of Check: correctness causal-adequacy (symptom vs. root cause), conformance Tier-5 scope, and the validation act (is this the right thing). Its mandate is to execute, not opine:

- Re-runs the asserted evidence (stash the fix → confirm red; unstash → confirm green; re-run the validator and semgrep itself).
- Re-checks that every path:line the builder cited resolves on the target branch; drops findings that do not ground.
- Per item emits `PASS / FAIL / NEEDS-HUMAN` with a one-line rationale and a path:line. No free-form prose verdict.

Advisory: it annotates, it does not gate. Deterministic gates block; the reviewer recommends; the human signs off Check.

---

## CHECK (assembled result) → `SUMMARY.md` (what the human signs off)

Assembled across Do (spec + claim) and Check (evidence + verdict). Its job: let the human complete Check — *clear NEEDS-HUMAN, weigh the advisory verdict, sign off the disposition* — without re-investigating, and capture any process-improvement hints for the next Act review. Required sections:

```
# Result — issue <id> / <slug>

## 1. Spec (from brief.md)              ← Check verifies against THIS
- Defect:
- Success criterion:
- Repo + branch target:
- Scope (one logical fix) / out of scope:

## 2. Disposition claimed               ← sign-off confirms or overrides
- Outcome: Fixed | Already-fixed | Can't-repro | Wontfix | By-design | External
- Confidence: high | medium | low
- Recommendation: merge-wider | close-<reason> | iterate-to-<beat>

## 3. Correctness (Check — chain)
- reproduction / verification / regression / causal-adequacy,
  each: result + oracle + evidence path. Causal-adequacy states the
  root cause and WHY this is cause not symptom (or → NEEDS-HUMAN).

## 4. Conformance (Check — stack)
- T1–T4 deterministic: pass/fail + rule IDs + path:line (from check-gates).
- T5 judgment: → see §5.

## 5. Advisory review (artifact-only, decorrelated)
- Reviewer summary, any FAILs, and the reviewer's RE-RUN results
  (red/green confirmed independently). Produced without build-notes.

## 6. NEEDS-HUMAN — items the human must clear before sign-off
- [ ] <decision only the human can make, and why a gate/reviewer couldn't>
  (empty ⇒ sign-off is a confirm; non-empty ⇒ each item cleared first)

## 7. Proven / not proven                ← oracle limits, stated honestly
- Proven by which oracle:
- Unproven / needs manual run (e.g. specific platform, visual sign-off):

## 8. Ready-to-ship attachments
- patch.diff
- pr-description.md      (only if a PR is warranted)
- tracker-comment.md     (ALWAYS, every tracker item)
- MANUAL-VERIFICATION.md (ANY manual-work outcome; also flagged at top)
- build-notes.md         (builder rationale — for the human signing off,
                          not the reviewer)

## 9. Check sign-off                     ← human completes Check here
- Disposition confirmed / overridden:
- Outcome: merged-wider | closed-<reason> | iterated-to-Do | iterated-to-Plan | discontinued
- Iteration delta (if iterating): <what the next Do or Plan must change
  for THIS cycle — distinct from process-level Act deltas, which go to §10;
  on a discontinue, the rationale for discontinuing / where the work goes instead>
- By / date:

## 10. Act candidates (hints for the next Act review)
- [ ] <process observation flagged for the next Act review>
      Examples:
      - "Spec-template field X was ambiguous — three Do attempts needed."
      - "No rule caught this defect class — candidate for a new Tier-2 check."
      - "The reviewer's grounding step took 3× longer than usual on this
        repo — agent-skill candidate."
  Empty is the common case. The next Act review collects these across
  cycles before deciding any concrete process change.
```

Why these sections, mapped to the question each serves: §1 is the yardstick Check measures against; §2 is the claim sign-off ratifies or overturns; §3–4 are the verification evidence (Check's deterministic product); §5 is the decorrelated second opinion the human weighs beside the builder's claim; §6 is the heart — the items Check explicitly could not decide, requiring the human to clear them; §7 stops the human from over-trusting a green (the oracle-limit honesty); §8 means once sign-off says "merge wider" there is no rework; §9 records the per-contribution verdict and, on iterate, the within-cycle delta; §10 is **separate** — it captures *process* observations that belong to Act, not the per-contribution disposition.

§9 vs §10 is the boundary the new model insists on. §9 closes the contribution. §10 is a hint feeder to a downstream Act review that operates on the *process*. Do not conflate them: a §10 entry is never required to clear before sign-off; a §9 outcome never decides what process change to make.

---

## CHECK (sign-off step) → cycle closes, bundle frozen

This is the human-instrumented step that **completes the CHECK beat** — not a separate beat. The gates and reviewer ran unattended; the SUMMARY.md was assembled; the human now completes Check by reading the bundle and signing off §9.

The human completes Check by reading `SUMMARY.md`:

1. Read §1, then §2 — does the claimed disposition match the spec?
2. Clear §6 (NEEDS-HUMAN) — each is a decision the gates and reviewer could not resolve: right bug? right spec? root cause or symptom-patch dressed as fix? worth doing at all?
3. Weigh §5 (decorrelated review) against §2/§3 — does the independent re-run agree?
4. Note §7 — is anything unproven that the disposition depends on?
5. Fill §9:
   - **accept** → merge wider. The push and draft-PR-open may already have happened during the cycle; accept performs the steps that were gated on sign-off: mark the PR ready, post the §8 tracker comment, merge. Cycle closes; bundle is frozen.
   - **iterate-to-Do** → builder re-runs against the same brief, new patch. Same cycle, new attempt. Bundle stays open until next sign-off.
   - **iterate-to-Plan** → human revises `brief.md`, builder re-runs against the new brief. Same cycle, revised spec. Bundle stays open.
6. Optionally fill §10 — note any process observations for the next Act review. Empty is normal.

A frozen bundle (sign-off accept) becomes Act material. Act does not run synchronously on cycle close; cycles close, accumulate, and a periodic Act review reads across them.

---

## ACT → `process/act-log.md` (process-level, cross-cycle)

Act fires periodically — after N completed cycles, on a calendar, or on-demand when a pattern surfaces. Its input is **the cycles' record**: their `SUMMARY.md` files (especially §6, §7, §9, §10), `build-notes.md`, `check-review.md`. Its output is **deltas to the process baseline**, recorded in a project-level append-only log.

The log is one file (or one directory of dated entries) at a project-
level path, separate from the per-issue bundles. Suggested name:
`process/act-log.md`. Each entry has:

```
# Act review — <date> — cycles considered: <issue_ids>

## What the cycles' records exposed
- <pattern observed across one or more cycles, with §10/§7/§6 citations>

## Process deltas
- Spec template: <field added / clarified / removed>            (file path)
- Ruleset: <rule added / retired / relaxed / tightened>         (path:line)
- Gates: <check added / promoted to gating / moved to new home> (path:line)
- Agent files: <.claude/agents/*.md / AGENTS.md adjustment>     (path:line)
- Orchestration: <driver / state / queue change>                (path:line)

## How effectiveness will be judged
- The next Do phases should not recreate <specific issue>.
- Watch for it in the next K cycles' records; if it recurs, this Act
  was not effective and the delta needs revisiting.
```

Each delta is **concrete and located** (a path, a rule ID, a template field) so a future reader — including a future Act review checking its predecessor's effectiveness — can verify both that the change was made and that the next cycles did not recreate the issue.

What Act does **not** do:

- Re-decide any contribution's disposition. Check sign-off already closed those.
- Run the validator or the suite. Check did.
- Author the next contribution's spec. The *next* Plan does that, with Act's improved baseline as its starting point.

---

## Independence contract (operational restatement)

The reviewer's value is decorrelation, and it is enforced by **file access, not prompt wording**:

- `check-review.md` is generated from `{patch.diff, test, brief.md, check-gates}` only. `build-notes.md` is **not** in its inputs — the builder's framing must not anchor the reviewer.
- The reviewer has execute access (run tests, run the validator, git stash/unstash) and **no write access to the fix** — it physically cannot patch what it is judging.
- `build-notes.md` joins the audit packet (§8) for the human only, after Check has run, so sign-off sees claim and independent verdict side by side.

**What this contract does and does not buy.** File-withholding decorrelates **evidence-integrity**, not **fix-correctness**:

- *Defends against:* the builder's narrative ("I tried X, ruled out Y, this is therefore root cause") anchoring the reviewer's reading of the patch. Stash → red / unstash → green confirms the shipped test fails pre-fix and passes post-fix, which the reviewer verifies by re-running, not by trusting the builder's report.
- *Does NOT defend against:* a plausible test that never actually exercises the real bug (the green is true of the test's narrow oracle, not of the defect); a framing blind spot the brief and test *both* carry into the reviewer (`brief.md` IS in the reviewer's input set — your framing of the defect and the success criterion is shared between builder and reviewer); causal-adequacy errors (symptom vs. root cause) that survive a passing test.

The reviewer attempts causal adequacy (correctness step 5) advisory, and may flag NEEDS-HUMAN when the evidence is insufficient. **The human at sign-off is the only real check on causal adequacy** — see [06 - Quality Cycle Guidelines](06-quality-cycle-guidelines.md) C6 (§6 must be empty before sign-off accepts). File-withholding is a useful piece of the mechanism but not the whole answer to "did this fix really work."

How this is enforced mechanically by the driver is the subject of [03 - Cycle Automation](03-cycle-automation.md) §Independence is enforced by the orchestrator.

## Bundle layout

Per-cycle (`results/issue_<id>/`):

```
results/issue_<id>/
  brief.md               # PLAN  — current contribution spec         (you)
  iteration-v1/          # a prior REJECTED attempt, archived intact on
  iteration-v2/          #         iterate (patch.diff, build-notes.md,
  ...                    #         SUMMARY.md, check-*, the test — plus
                         #         brief.md on iterate-to-Plan); only
                         #         present once an iterate fired (see [03 -
                         #         Cycle Automation](03-cycle-automation.md) §Driver skeleton)
  patch.diff             # DO    — the change                        (builder)
  <test file>            # DO    — ships with the patch              (builder)
  build-notes.md         # DO    — rationale, withheld from reviewer (builder)
  check-gates.md|json    # CHECK — deterministic gate results        (gates)
  check-review.md        # CHECK — advisory verdict, artifact-only   (reviewer)
  SUMMARY.md             # DO+CHECK — RESULT DOC, ends in §9 sign-off (assembled)
  pr-description.md       # attachment, if PR warranted
  tracker-comment.md      # attachment, ALWAYS
  MANUAL-VERIFICATION.md  # attachment, any manual-work outcome
  commit-msg.txt         # CHECK/publish — contribution artifact      (publisher)
  publish.json           # CHECK/publish — record of the opened draft PR (driver)
```

Iterate-archive discipline: an iterate **moves** the previous attempt into `iteration-v<N>/` (N = next available integer) rather than deleting it — a rejected attempt is preserved, not lost. iterate-to-Do archives the Do+Check downstream and the bundle-local test, leaving `brief.md` for the rebuild (state → PLANNED); iterate-to-Plan archives `brief.md` too (state → UNPLANNED, the human re-authors). Both first fold the prior attempt's sign-off rationale + failing gates into the brief's `## Iteration N — carry-forward` block, so the next beat (which reads `brief.md`) isn't blind. The accumulating `iteration-v1/`, `iteration-v2/`, … match the case study's CLAUDE_CODE_BRIEF v1/v2/v3 sequence ([07 - Case Study - CI Hardening](07-case-study-ci-hardening.md) §Turn 2).

Project-level (one location for all cycles' process-level work):

```
process/
  act-log.md             # ACT  — append-only log of process deltas (you)
  spec-template.md       # the current brief.md template Act maintains
  ruleset/               # the current conformance ruleset (Tiers 1–4)
```

The leaf instruction files Act also maintains live at `.claude/agents/*.md` (the
six subagents: planner, builder, reviewer, signoff, publisher, act) plus `AGENTS.md`
for the cross-vendor reviewer.

The minimal per-cycle bundle is `SUMMARY.md`, `patch.diff`, `pr-description.md`, `tracker-comment.md`, `MANUAL-VERIFICATION.md`. The operational layer above adds `brief.md` (names the Plan artifact explicitly), `build-notes.md` (separates builder rationale for the independence contract), and the two `check-*` artifacts (makes Check's product auditable rather than implicit), and reframes `SUMMARY.md` as ending in **Check sign-off** (§9), with §10 as a lightweight feeder to the *project-level* Act log.
