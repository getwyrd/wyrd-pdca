"""The session side of the interactive PDCA leaves' exit contract (issues #331, #534).

The interactive leaves (Plan, sign-off, publish, Act) each have a checkable exit
contract. The driver judges it when it reaps the leaf's process and reports what it
finds to the human (``pdca_harness.handoff.session``). This script is what the session
itself runs (vendor-neutral CLI):

* **``--check <id>``** (used by the rendered ``/handoff`` command): verify the current
  leaf's contract for ONE required id; PASS ⇒ 0, FAIL ⇒ 1. There is no scan mode. The
  verdict is exit status + report — nothing is written to the bundle.
* **``--abandon "<why>"``**: record a TYPED reason in the driver's session channel; when
  the session ends the driver prints it, followed by everything its exit-contract check
  finds (an abandon explains the gap and hides none of it).
* **No arguments** is how the retired #331 **Stop** hook registration ran this script,
  and it is inert: exit 0, no output, stdin unread. Stop fires every time the main agent
  finishes a turn, not when the session ends, and a Stop hook's exit 2 sends its stderr
  back to the model instead of handing the turn to the human. So a leaf that asked the
  human a question never reached them: the model was told to write the missing artifact
  (for sign-off, the human's own decision) and was blocked again on every turn (#534).
  The template no longer registers the hook. An instance whose ``settings.json`` still
  does (a ``copier update`` merge that kept it) must not deadlock, so this path does
  nothing.

All contract logic lives in ``pdca_harness.handoff`` (plain Python, unit-tested
offline); this file only bootstraps the import and speaks the CLI.
