# Bootstrap + self-test only. The CYCLE is run through the console script, the
# cross-platform run interface (issue #85):
#
#   <cli> flow <id> [<id> …]   run the cycle for one issue (or several → batch)
#   <cli> flow … --rehearse    dry-run on stub leaves + stub gates (no Claude/Docker)
#   <cli>                      the status dashboard (bare invocation)
#   <cli> --help              every subcommand
#
# `<cli>` is this project's console script (named per pyproject [project.scripts] —
# the cli_name copier answer). Before `make install`, run it as
# `python -m pdca_harness.cli …` (PYTHONPATH=src from a source checkout).
#
# This Makefile scopes to what is genuinely per-platform — bootstrap — plus the dev
# self-test. On Windows use scripts/install.ps1 (GNU make isn't standard there).
#
#   make install    bootstrap every tool `flow` needs (issue #207): harness-universal
#                    tools (git, gh, venv), the configured leaf backends, and this
#                    instance's gate toolchain via the bootstrap-tools.d/ hook +
#                    [install].extra_bootstrap, then install the console script.
#                    Idempotent; see scripts/bootstrap-tools.sh. `make install-check`
#                    reports tool status without installing anything.
#   make setup      one-time: grant Claude read of the workspace (permissions)
#   make            full self-test: offline guards + a real driver cycle on stub leaves
