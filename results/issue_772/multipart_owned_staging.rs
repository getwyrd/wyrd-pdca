//! Issue #772 — the multipart **owned staging entry**: the `sidx:<upload-id>:<part-number>:<chunk-id>`
//! value (`wyrd_core::multipart::{OwnedEntry, StagedPlacement, decode_owned_entry}`) and the two
//! additive ownership fields it adds to the shared `wyrd_core::metadata::PendingEntry` (proposal
//! 0016, `:353`, `:442-491`) — and, because `sidx:` and `pending:` are two key spaces sharing one
//! value shape, the `pending:` half of the same boundary (`metadata::decode_pending_entry`, the
//! `pending:` readers that now go through it, and the two `pending:` writers that apply its rule
//! to what they store).
//!
//! Mirrors `multipart_session_records.rs` (#716) and `multipart_retire_obligation.rs` (#771):
//! hand-authored JSON bytes and the production codec, every witness **decoded rather than
//! constructed** — S3's torn literal and the minted entries aside, whose whole point is what a
//! caller outside the crate can build. Each namespace has two decode surfaces, asserted to agree
//! wherever they can: the namespace's own entry point (`decode_owned_entry`, `decode_pending_entry`)
//! and the store-wide `metadata::decode::<PendingEntry>`, which judges the value's shape alone and
//! so can see neither key relation (the owner, the namespace). Serialization identity is asserted
//! over every accepted witness by `decode_owned_witness` / `decode_pending_witness` — the
//! `decode_both` shape of `multipart_session_records.rs:169`.
//!
//! Unlike its siblings this file is not wholly pure. Its store legs drive production code over an
//! in-process `RedbMetadataStore` — the harness `stream_lease_lapse.rs` and
//! `stream_lease_renewal.rs` already use for these same functions — because what they own is what
//! a **reader** or **writer** does with a misfiled value, which no decode-only witness shows:
//! `renew_pending`, `live_lease_guards` (reached through `create_leased`),
//! `write::sweep_expired_leases` and `put_pending`. The fourth `pending:` reader, the custodian GC's
//! expired-lease scan, has its leg in `crates/custodian/tests/gc.rs`, since it needs the custodian
//! crate.
//!
//! The legs (Success criterion, brief #772), each asserted in **one** test so that negating one
//! production rule fails exactly that test:
//!
//! * **S1** staged geometry — `rs(0,1)`/`rs(3,0)` are `StagedSchemeUnsupported`, at decode and at
//!   the checked constructor alike;
//! * **S2** key/value agreement — an owner other than the key's upload id is refused;
//! * **S3** torn shape — exactly one ownership field is `TornOwnedEntry` under **both** namespaces,
//!   whether the bytes are hand-written or encoded from a literal an outside caller assembled, and
//!   that literal is never stored under `pending:`;
//! * **S4** namespace agreement — each namespace's entry point refuses the other's shape, the two
//!   lease readers in `metadata.rs` refuse a misfiled owned entry rather than renew it or commit
//!   over it, and the two `pending:` writers refuse to store one (asserting only that they refuse —
//!   their boxed error type is not this child's);
//! * **S5** (core half) — the lease sweep skips what it cannot read, reclaims nothing on it,
//!   completes for every other entry on either side of it, and reports each skipped key rather
//!   than returning success — over a named fixture and over seeded populations (Tier 0);
//! * **S6** — a length-mismatched staged placement **decodes** (the contextual check, not this
//!   decode's);
//! * **S7** — an ordinary `pending:` entry re-encodes byte-identically, the omitted-when-absent
//!   fields asserted rather than assumed;
//! * **S8** — an owned entry re-encodes byte-identically across a renewal that moves only its lease,
//!   and a foreign spelling of one is refused rather than accepted and rewritten;
//! * **S9** — an owned entry is minted from outside the crate through the public checked path, both
//!   decoders agree on what it is, and the public validator refuses a hand-built record of either
//!   other shape.
//!
//! No `#![cfg(...)]` here — this file always compiles and always runs.
