//! Issue #800 (a child of #637, split from #661): GC **sweeps an `orphan:` mark whose position
//! holds no fragment**, once no fragment can still land under it (proposal 0016,
//! `0016:1359-1408`, X87, X91, X96).
//!
//! On `main`, GC consumes a mark only while it walks a `list_fragments()` result (the fleet walk in
//! `crates/custodian/src/gc.rs`), so a mark whose position holds no fragment is never visited and
//! never deleted. `main` already writes such marks — every repair of a missing fragment marks that
//! fragment's old position (`crates/custodian/src/reconstruction.rs`), where by definition nothing
//! is stored — and 0016 adds producers by design. The paged walk survives the ledger's size, but
//! every lap re-reads marks nothing will ever remove.
//!
//! **`D`, the late-write deadline, is hard-coded: 41 s** — `W_repoint + W_write + δ_clock`, that is
//! 10 s + 30 s + 1 s (`gc::LATE_WRITE_DEADLINE_MILLIS`). It is written as a number because this
//! file compiles against `main`, where no such constant exists, and so that a change to it fails
//! here instead of silently moving the bound this file pins. [`GRACE`] is the deployed grace window
//! (`GC_GRACE_WINDOW_MILLIS` = `LEASE_TTL_MILLIS`, `crates/server/src/custodian.rs`) and [`W`] the
//! production batch (`gc::CLEANUP_BATCH`), pinned the same way.
//!
//! Every leg runs the production `reconcile_step`, with a FRESH `GcContext` per pass, as the
//! deployed loop builds one (`crates/server/src/custodian.rs`), over in-memory doubles built as
//! `gc_ledger_walk.rs` builds them: a metadata double over an ordered map with a lowered cap, whose
//! `scan_page` pages its own truth, and D-server doubles whose `list_fragments()` the test
//! controls. The metadata double injects what the legs need — a writer landing between the pass's
//! read of a mark and its delete, a commit that fails — and logs every commit and every keyed read
//! in order. Structured and `reclaiming` values are seeded as raw JSON, as 0016 spells them, and
//! the audit trail is read back as the pass wrote it. The file names no symbol the change adds, so
//! it compiles against `main` and fails there by assertion. Every leg that asserts a mark survives
//! also seeds a control the pass does sweep, so no such leg passes on a pass that swept nothing.
//!
//! The legs:
//!
//! * **A** — a fragment-less mark aged exactly `D`, judged on this pass's own listing, is deleted,
//!   by a delete conditioned on the value read, and the delete is audited on the durability seam
//!   and counted. `main`: it survives every pass.
//! * **B** — only then. (i) The same mark aged `D − 1` survives. (ii) So does one whose D server is
//!   not in the pass's fleet. (iii) A listed position is the reclaim's, not the sweep's. (iv) A
//!   listing from an earlier pass never licenses a sweep (X96). (v) A fleet naming one server twice
//!   never makes a listed position look unlisted. (vi) An incomplete reference set sweeps nothing
//!   (the pass answers `Blocked`), and a referenced position is never swept. (vii) Each of the
//!   three value shapes is swept on its own stamp; a value that is none of them is never swept,
//!   stays byte-identical and is named.
//! * **D** — a sweep never deletes a mark newer than the one it judged, and its accounting matches
//!   what landed. (i) A mark re-stamped between the pass's read and its delete survives, and is
//!   neither audited nor counted. (ii) A commit that fails partway through the sweep leaves claimed
//!   exactly the deletes that landed — across a batch boundary and inside the per-mark retry. (iii)
//!   After a lost precondition the pass concludes only what a fresh read of the mark shows: a mark
//!   rewritten and then deleted under it is claimed neither swept nor protecting, and one that
//!   still reads as it did is left for the next pass.
//! * **E** — a differently spelled key never costs a mark: it lends the mark neither its stamp nor
//!   its listing, and is itself never deleted or rewritten, only named.
//!
//! Leg C — `D` strictly inside the deployed grace — is a compile-time assertion beside the deployed
//! constant (`crates/server/src/custodian.rs`), and the seeded DST property is property 15 of
//! `crates/dst/tests/custodian.rs`.
