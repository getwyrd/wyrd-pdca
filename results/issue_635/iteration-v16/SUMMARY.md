# Result — issue 635 / segmented-chunk-map

## 1. Spec (from brief.md)              ← Check verifies against THIS
- Defect / goal:
  `InodeRecord.chunk_map` graduates from a flat list to **`Flat | Segmented`**, so a
  published map larger than one backend value can exist at all — the >10 GiB launch requirement.
  Flat stays exactly as it is (`crates/core/src/metadata.rs:268`, `pub chunk_map: Vec<ChunkRef>`)
  and every existing record keeps decoding **byte-identically**; segmented carries a group
  identity plus `seg:<group-nonce>:<epoch>:<index>` segment records and their `seggrp:`
  reservation, is published by **staged publication** (write the segments, then flip the root),
  and is resolved through **one shared resolver that every `.chunk_map` consumer goes through**.
- Success criterion:
  **ONE** new test file (leg A, the binding one — deliberately written to
  compile on this bundle's base so its RED is an assertion, not a build error), plus co-located
  unit tests (leg B) and the whole gate (leg C).
  **(A) BINDING — every maintenance consumer resolves the segmented shape, and the proof is a
  positive observable, not an absence.** `crates/custodian/tests/segmented_map_consumers.rs`
  seeds a **committed segmented object by raw record bytes** through `MetadataStore::commit`
  (the encoding is settled below, so no symbol this slice adds is named) plus its fragments on
  in-memory D-server doubles, then asserts, in one test binary:
  (i) **`reconcile_step` succeeds** with GC + scrub + reconstruction + rebalance contexts all
  supplied (`crates/custodian/src/reconciliation.rs:65-74`) — on the base it returns `Err`,
  because `referenced_fragments` decodes every `inode:` value with `metadata::decode(&value)?`
  (`crates/custodian/src/gc.rs:251`, `:256`) and a segmented value is not a JSON array;
  (ii) **the segmented object's fragments are in the protected set — asserted positively.**
  `desired_state::reconciliation_status(meta, S)` for a server `S` that holds one of the
  segmented object's fragments, with `desired:dserver:S` seeded, MUST answer **`Pending`**
  (`crates/custodian/src/desired_state.rs:150-165`). A resolver that decodes the new shape but
  never reads the `seg:` range answers `Satisfied` — this is the leg that catches it, and
  nothing else does;
  (iii) **restore does not strand it.** `reconcile_after_restore` reports
  `RestoreReport::stranded_marked == 0` (`crates/custodian/src/restore.rs:108`, `:145`, `:179`).
  This is the #508-attempt-4 failure mode in its exact shape: a resolver used only by
  the read path while `gc.rs` and `restore.rs` still iterated `record.chunk_map` directly, so a
  restore pass stranded a live segmented object and a later GC pass deleted its fragments;
  (iv) **and the data loss that follows is pinned.** Advance past the orphan grace window and run
  a second GC pass: **every fragment the segmented object's resolved map names is still present**.
  Under the (iii) failure the marks laid by restore would now be reclaimed — assert the fragment
  count directly, not `Reconciled::Satisfied`;
  (v) **a flat object in the same store is unaffected** — same passes, same assertions, and its
  stored `inode:` bytes are unchanged byte-for-byte after every pass.
  (vi) **The consumers `reconcile_step` does NOT dispatch get their own positive observable.**
  `reconcile_step` runs GC, scrub, reconstruction and rebalance only
  (`crates/custodian/src/reconciliation.rs:65-114`) — it dispatches **neither backfill nor either
  read path**, and reconstruction reaches `find_chunk` only for a **queued** repair
  (`crates/custodian/src/reconstruction.rs:130-183`), which legs A(i)–(v) never enqueue. So
  `reconcile_step(...).is_ok()` binds four consumers, not eight, and the remaining four would ship
  unresolved behind a green criterion. Add, each asserting a **positive** result rather than
  absence of error: **the gateway read path** returns a segmented object's bytes byte-identical
  (whole-object *and* a range that spans a segment boundary — the ranged walk is a separate
  `.chunk_map` consumer, `crates/server/src/lib.rs:446`); **`core`'s read path** resolves it
  (`crates/core/src/read.rs:92`); **reconstruction** resolves a segmented chunk for an
  **explicitly enqueued** repair instead of dropping it; and **backfill** takes its stated decision
  (resolve, or skip with a reason) rather than mangling the map (`crates/custodian/src/backfill.rs:76-130`).
  **WHERE each of these lives — this is not free choice, and getting it wrong breaks the gate.**
  `wyrd-server` depends on `wyrd-custodian` (`crates/server/Cargo.toml:63`), so the reverse edge is
  a **dependency cycle**: the gateway legs **cannot** live in the custodian test binary, and
  `wyrd-server` must not be added to `crates/custodian/Cargo.toml`. Nor may they ship as a new
  `crates/server/tests/*.rs` file — that is a second **added** test target, which C4-verify folds
  into the same cargo invocation and keeps on the RED leg, so its compile error (it names types
  this slice adds) would destroy leg A's assertion red. **The two gateway legs therefore ship as
  co-located `#[cfg(test)]` tests inside `crates/server/src/lib.rs`** (where the ranged walk lives),
  exactly as iteration 5 did. Everything else in leg A stays in the one added custodian test file:
  `wyrd-custodian` depends on `wyrd-core`, and `wyrd_core::read` (`crates/core/src/lib.rs:14`,
  entry points `read.rs:29`, `:44`, `:58`) and `metadata::high_water_marks` are public, so the core
  read path, the custodian consumers and the allocator floor are all reachable from it.
  (vii) **NEW — one damaged object does not take the store down (the containment rule, see
  `Design § Failure containment`).** Seed a THIRD object: segmented, committed, whose root still
  names its group but whose `seg:<nonce>:<epoch>:000001` record is **absent**. Then assert, in the
  same store that holds the healthy flat and healthy segmented objects:
  **(a) `metadata::high_water_marks` returns `Ok`** (`crates/core/src/metadata.rs:847`) and its
  chunk floor is **≥ every chunk id present in any `seg:` record in the store** — this is the leg
  that stops `Gateway::recover` (`crates/server/src/lib.rs:123-124`, called before serving) from
  refusing to start the whole gateway because one object is damaged;
  **(b) the healthy objects still read** — byte-identical, with the damaged object present in the
  same store (the `core::read` half in the custodian test file, the whole-object + ranged gateway
  half with the co-located server tests, per the placement rule in (vi));
  **(c) the damaged object fails closed, per object** — a read of *it* is a typed error, never
  torn or partial bytes;
  **(d) nothing of the damaged object is reclaimed** — after a GC pass and past the grace window,
  the fragments its readable segments name are still present. (Whether the deletion-capable pass
  returns `Err` or completes while protecting them is Do's call — see the containment table — but
  **no fragment may be deleted**.)
  **(B) The record shape, the CAS identity, and staged publication.** These name types this slice
  ADDS, so they **must NOT ship as a second added `tests/*.rs` file**: `run-verify.sh` collects
  every added test target into **one** cargo invocation (`engine/scripts/run-verify.sh:286-311`,
  `:332-342`) and keeps them all on the RED leg (`:404-415`), so a compile-red file would fail the
  whole invocation and **destroy leg A's assertion red** — the single most valuable thing this
  slice has. Ship leg B as **co-located `#[cfg(test)]` unit tests inside the production modules**
  they exercise (`crates/core/src/metadata.rs`, and the committer's own module), which
  `cargo xtask ci` runs and C4-verify never retains. Over `RedbMetadataStore::in_memory()`:
  (i) **Legacy decode→encode is the identity, byte-for-byte.** Take the *exact* stored bytes of a
  pre-existing flat `InodeRecord` (including one with `etag`/`content_type`/`modified` absent),
  decode and re-encode, assert equality. This is not hygiene: every CAS in
  `crates/core/src/metadata.rs` is `require(key, encode(prior))` compared byte-for-byte against
  the stored value (the `skip_serializing_if` rationale at `crates/core/src/metadata.rs:277-289`),
  so a `chunk_map` whose encoding gained a tag or a wrapper turns **every overwrite, backfill,
  reconstruction and rebalance of every pre-existing object** into a permanent `Conflict`. Assert
  it end-to-end too: `metadata::commit_chunk_map` against a legacy record must return
  `Committed`, not `Conflict`.
  (ii) **The segmented encoding is exactly the one settled below, and its structural invariants
  are enforced AT DECODE.** Assert `encode(Segmented{…})` equals the canonical JSON the test spells
  out literally and decodes back — that keeps leg A's hand-written fixture honest. But a single
  valid example is not an oracle for an invariant: this repo requires structural invariants to be
  **rejected at decode rather than admitted as values** (parse-don't-validate,
  `../wyrd/AGENTS.md:146-149`). So add a **raw-byte negative case per invariant**, each asserting a
  typed decode error and **no partial resolution**: `segment_count != segments.len()`; a duplicate
  `index`; a gap in the index sequence; non-monotonic or overlapping `byte_offset`/`byte_len`; a
  `nonce` that is not 32 lowercase hex; a segment key whose index is not the fixed width. Without
  these the shape is a suggestion, and a malformed record becomes a torn map at the first
  consumer.
  (iii) **Staged publication**: writing a segmented map's `seg:` records in byte-budgeted batches
  and then flipping the root is one committer, and the flip is **one** batch carrying the root
  CAS. Assert: after the segment-write phase and before the flip, the root still names the prior
  generation; after the flip, the root names the group and a resolve returns the full ordered
  chunk list; the flip batch's total mutation **bytes** stay inside the stated envelope
  (the segment-write batches at `≤ E_tx/2`, `0016:2331-2337`; the flip's own inventory bound
  `≤ 4·V + O(1)`, `0016:654-663`) and no single value exceeds the 100 KB ceiling
  (`crates/traits/src/lib.rs:997`) — measure the encoded bytes, do not assert a record count.
  **The operation-count half of the envelope is also normative** — "`B` is therefore
  `min(B_bytes, B_ops)` … every row of the batch inventory whose mutation or precondition **count**
  can grow is bounded by both" (`0016:640-648`) — so the split and the flip are bounded by ops as
  well as bytes, with a typed refusal for each. (Iteration 5 already implemented this; it is
  restated because an earlier round wrongly declined it.)
  (iv) **The publication refuses BEFORE it makes anything durable.** Every deterministic,
  zero-I/O refusal the committer can raise — unfenced, colliding caller contribution, a value over
  the ceiling, a key over the ceiling, batch over bytes, batch over ops — must be decided
  **before the first `seg:` record is written**, so a refused publication leaves **zero** durable
  `seg:` rows and no caller cursor movement. Assert both: a flip contribution carrying an
  over-ceiling value, and a flip with no fence, each ⇒ typed `Err` **and** a store containing no
  `seg:` record for that group. (Iteration-5 refutation 1 — the patch shipped the opposite order.)
  (v) **A resumed publication verifies the durable prefix it is trusting.** A caller resuming at
  `resume_from = N` must not be taken at its word: before the flip, the committer re-reads at least
  the last durable segment (`seg:<group>:<epoch>:<N-1>`) and compares it against the segment its
  own re-derived plan puts at that index, refusing with a typed error on mismatch. Assert the
  probe: publish attempt 1 writes N segments for chunk list A and stops; attempt 2 resumes at N
  with a chunk list differing only in `chunks[0].len` — the flip must **refuse**, not commit a
  root that no consumer can ever resolve. (Iteration-5 refutation 2. If Do concludes this belongs
  to #636's session contract instead, that is a legitimate call — but it must then be **recorded**
  in `review-rejected.md` with its reason, not left implicit.)
  (vi) **The resolver is total, bounded, and orders segments ITSELF.** It reads the root plus the
  bounded range `scan("seg:<nonce>:<epoch>:")` and nothing else — never a global `seg:` scan
  (`0016:2463-2469`). Assert by seeding a *second* group's segments in the same store and checking
  they are neither read nor returned. **And it must not rely on scan order:**
  `MetadataStore::scan` leaves order *unspecified* (`crates/traits/src/lib.rs:1021-1023`) and #634
  makes byte-lexicographic order normative **only for `scan_page`** (`:1037-1046`), leaving `scan`
  untouched — so the fixed-width zero-padded index is a *debuggability and key-hygiene* property,
  **not** a licence to concatenate in returned order. The resolver parses each segment's `index`
  and orders by it explicitly, rejecting a gap or a duplicate. Assert with a **deliberately
  shuffling** store double that returns the range reversed: resolution must still yield the correct
  byte order. (The bounded `scan` is deliberate: `MAX_ROOT_SEGMENTS` keeps one group's range inside
  the cap, so this slice does not need `scan_page` even though the base now offers it.)
  (vii) **A rolled-back attempt's segments are disjoint from a later attempt's** — seed
  `seg:<nonce>:1:*` and `seg:<nonce>:2:*` and assert resolving the root at epoch 2 returns only
  epoch 2's chunks (the F18 epoch-scoping property, `0016:2352-2380`).
  (viii) **Decision 7(h)'s resolve-retry rule, which the resolver's SIGNATURE must be able to
  express** (`0016:2452-2474`). A generation's `seg:` records are deleted by retirement and
  rollback, so a consumer midway through a segmented resolve can see a segment **absent**. The
  rule is: re-read the **root**; a root now naming a **different group** or **absent** means the
  generation was concurrently retired (a reader restarts against the current root or answers
  `NoSuchKey`; a maintenance pass drops the stale resolution); a root **unchanged** with a segment
  **absent** is an **invariant violation and MUST fail closed** — an error, never a torn success
  (the *Absent or unsupported entries* rule, `../wyrd/AGENTS.md:175-177`). **A resolver that takes
  only a store and an already-decoded `InodeRecord` cannot do this** — it has no way to re-read the
  root. So the API must carry the root's identity (the inode key/id, or a re-read closure) and
  return a retry-or-fail outcome. Assert both arms: changed root → restart/drop; unchanged root
  with a missing segment → typed error and **no partial map**. A *complete* resolve of a
  superseded generation settles the same way (the currency re-read is not skipped just because
  every segment happened to be readable). The interleaving itself (X51) goes into the existing
  `crates/dst/tests/custodian.rs`, never a new DST file (see `Test file`).
  **(C) `cargo xtask ci` green**, including the docs gates — see `Impact & compatibility` for the
  architecture-doc currency requirement, which is a **merge requirement**
  (`../wyrd/AGENTS.md:154-157`), not a follow-up.
- Repo + branch target: getwyrd/wyrd @ main
- Scope (one logical fix) / out of scope:
  the `Flat | Segmented` record shape and its settled encoding, the `seg:` /
  `seggrp:` records and their key helpers (`crates/core/src/metadata.rs`); the staged
  segment-write + root-flip committer, with the publication precondition taken as a **parameter**;
  the one shared resolver and **every** `.chunk_map` consumer routed through it (the eight sites
  tabled in `Design`), each with its stated failure-containment behaviour; the architecture-doc
  currency edit; and the one new test file plus co-located units. **Out of
  scope:** the multipart session/records/protocol (#636), the S3 verbs (#508), the staged-byte
  protection class (#637), `PutObject` chunk-size selection (#508 — a single PUT never segments),
  FU-1's record-shape ADR (#628), FU-5's part-record segmentation (#632), the destination
  drain-fence question carried in `review-batch.md` (see `Carry-forward`), and any file under
  `docs/design/adr/` or `docs/design/specs/`.

## 5. Advisory review (artifact-only, decorrelated)
Reviewer ran without build-notes.md. Summary:

Reviewing issue #635: introduce a byte-compatible segmented inode chunk map, staged publication, and shared resolution across every reader and maintenance consumer.

| Item | Verdict | Basis |
|------|---------|-------|
| C1 Spec | PASS | The brief fixes the wire identity, consumer inventory, failure-containment rules, publication boundary, and exact base, so the implementation has a complete and falsifiable contract. |
| C2 Reproduction (red pre-fix) | PASS | With production changes stashed but the binding test retained, 12/12 tests ran and failed by assertion/runtime decode; restoring the patch made the same 12/12 pass, matching the fixture's intended pre-fix failure at `crates/custodian/tests/segmented_map_consumers.rs:14`. |
| C3 Change | PASS | The scope stays on the record, resolver, publication, affected consumers, tests, and required architecture docs; the representation and common resolution seam are explicit at `crates/core/src/metadata.rs:1329` and `crates/core/src/metadata.rs:2974`. |
| C4 Verification (red→green) | NEEDS-HUMAN | Decide whether to accept the recorded full-gate green or require another clean-host run—the independent run passed lint/build/unit/deny/conformance and all three new segmented DST properties but then hung in the known baseline regression-seed test at `crates/dst/tests/custodian.rs:2457`, so only the 12-test red→green was fully reproduced. |
| C5 Causal adequacy | NEEDS-HUMAN [impl] | The rebuild must demonstrate that both allocator-floor readers protect distinct failure cases—the reported surviving removals of unreadable-ID counting and nested-array traversal at `crates/core/src/metadata.rs:5192` and `crates/core/src/metadata.rs:5198` were not independently rerunnable after the baseline hang, leaving the anti-ID-reuse causal claim provisional. |
| T1 Structure | PASS | The dependency direction remains acyclic and the two cross-cutting decisions are findable at one core resolver and one custodian classifier, `crates/core/src/metadata.rs:2974` and `crates/custodian/src/resolve.rs:243`. |
| T2 Shape | PASS | Stored-data invariants are enforced at construction and decode rather than deferred to consumers, including root tiling at `crates/core/src/metadata.rs:1190` and segment span checks at `crates/core/src/metadata.rs:1461`. |
| T3 Runtime | NEEDS-HUMAN | The maintainer must accept landing the generic fenced committer before #636 supplies the real `Completing@E` producer and accept one root `get` per committed object per maintenance pass—this affects deployability and scan cost (`crates/core/src/metadata.rs:3450`, `crates/custodian/src/resolve.rs:39`). |
| T4 Contribution | NEEDS-HUMAN | A human must inspect the three reported batch-review blockers and settle affected-file closed/rejected prior art—the configured `scripts/review-branch` scanner is absent from the allowed target/artifact scope, so its red result could not be independently reproduced or triaged; merged-history and GitHub term probes found no prior segmented implementation. |
| T5 Judgment | NEEDS-HUMAN [impl] | The rebuild must pin observably significant surviving mutations such as resumed-publication cursor advancement and unresolvable-object accounting—changes at `crates/core/src/metadata.rs:4065` and `crates/custodian/src/rebalance.rs:210` reportedly survive, so the tests do not yet prove those recovery and operator-signal claims. |
| Validation — fitness-to-purpose | NEEDS-HUMAN | Decide whether raw-seeded in-memory fixtures are sufficient for this precursor or require #636's real `Completing@E` path on a backend-sized multi-segment object; this matters because production publication/rollback fitness is not exercised by the synthetic setup documented at `crates/custodian/tests/segmented_map_consumers.rs:14`. |

- Iteration delta (if iterating): Rejected on: (1) C5 surviving mutants — 14 missed mutants on the bundle diff (crates/core/src/metadata.rs:5192, :5198 and others per check-review.md) are not yet killed/covered by tests; (2) T4 batched review — 3 fresh blocking findings in review-batch.md are unresolved (not fixed, not recorded-rejected): - crates/custodian/src/gc.rs:335 — unresolvable inode in a partial ReferenceSet lets scrub::reconcile skip its fragments and wrongly report Satisfied. - crates/core/src/metadata.rs:5162 — a structurally invalid seg: value (e.g. {}) contributes zero to high_water_marks instead of the conservative ceiling, under-reporting live chunk IDs. - crates/core/src/metadata.rs:2874 — segment decode/bounds failures bypass the root re-read, so a request racing an overwrite can fail on corruption in a retired generation instead of resolving the healthy replacement. Next attempt: fix (or explicitly record-reject with reason in review-rejected.md) each of the 3 T4 findings above, and add/adjust tests to kill the 14 surviving mutants reported by C5, then re-run the full gate stack.
