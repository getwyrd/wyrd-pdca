//! **Tier-1 Jepsen consistency scenario test** (Milestone 3, proposal 0005 §13.2,
//! `0005:408`; the `xtask` crate touch-point `0005:437-438`).
//!
//! What this test proves that no in-process test can: the **production custodian repair
//! path** (`custodian::reconcile_step` → `reconstruction::reconcile`) upholds the
//! **ADR-0015 consistency contract** over **real gRPC D-server containers** when the
//! cluster is hit by a **crash** (a killed node — `docker kill`) and an **isolation
//! nemesis** on a second node. Two isolation nemeses are covered, in two separate
//! scenario functions (issue #399, ADR-0039's named additive upgrade):
//!
//! - [`jepsen_consistency_over_repair_under_partition_and_crash`] — Jepsen's `:pause`:
//!   a freezer-cgroup process freeze (`docker pause` / `docker unpause`). The isolated
//!   node's own clock **stops**. Cheaper; kept as the existing leg (#250).
//! - [`jepsen_consistency_over_repair_under_live_partition_and_crash`] — Jepsen's
//!   `:partition`: a network-level packet drop (an in-netns `iptables` DROP on the gRPC
//!   port, injected by a `--net container:<isolated>` sidecar) that keeps the container
//!   `running` **and preserves its published-port mapping**. The isolated node stays
//!   **live** on its own clock, network-unreachable, for the fault window, then is
//!   reachable again at the SAME endpoint on heal — the property
//!   [`assert_node_live_during_isolation`] asserts and the freeze leg cannot exhibit.
//!
//! `xtask/src/faults.rs`'s `IsolationNemesis` value (mirroring `jepsen_dispatch`'s
//! born-at-tier pattern, `xtask/src/faults.rs:179`) decides which of the two functions
//! each `cargo xtask jepsen` leg runs.
//!
//! # ADR-0015 contract asserted (`0005:381-403`)
//!
//! 1. **Commit-point-atomic repair under crash** — a crash before the version-conditional
//!    commit leaves the chunk **fully old, never a hybrid** (`0005:385-389`): the
//!    placed-but-uncommitted rebuilt fragment is **collectable garbage** on the spare
//!    server, the committed inode is untouched (victim still in placement — fully old).
//! 2. **Commit-point-atomic repair under partition** — a network partition mid-repair
//!    causes the repair pass to **abort** (transient error, never a partial commit): the
//!    committed inode is unchanged after the aborted pass.
//! 3. **Read-after-commit** — after the repair commits, every server in the committed
//!    placement holds a readable fragment. A committed server that becomes unreadable is
//!    a violation, not a valid state.
//! 4. **Exactly-once convergence** — repair commits exactly once across the partition
//!    heal: the inode version increments by exactly 1 (not 0, not 2+). A second
//!    reconcile step on an empty queue returns Satisfied without re-committing.
//! 5. **Data integrity** — erasure-decoding any K of the N post-repair fragments
//!    reconstructs the original bytes exactly.
//!
//! The RS(6,3) cluster has [`JC_DSERVER_COUNT`] = 10 servers: nine hold the initial
//! N=9 fragments; the tenth (the spare, domain J) receives the rebuilt fragment.
//! Server 0 (domain A) is killed; server 1 (domain B) is partitioned mid-repair.
//!
//! # Production reach
//!
//! The repair trigger is the **sanctioned `enqueue_repair` test stand-in** (the same
//! bridge `tier2_kill_reconstruct.rs:545` uses, `0005:Production-reach`): no production
//! path today enqueues repair for a simply-missing fragment (the missing-fragment
//! detection product gap is a filed follow-on). The `reconcile_step` →
//! `reconstruction::reconcile` path is genuinely traversed against the live cluster —
//! nothing is stubbed after the enqueue.
//!
//! # Gating
//!
//! The test body is `#[ignore]`d — `cargo xtask ci`'s `cargo test --workspace`
//! **compiles and type-checks** this file (proving the harness is real API-bound Rust,
//! not an env-var shell string) without running it. The live execution (`--ignored`)
//! happens only in the privileged off-Check job (`WYRD_TIER1=1`), run by
//! `cargo xtask jepsen`.
//!
//! **Born-at-tier coverage** at Check: the six assertion helpers
//! ([`assert_commit_point_atomic`], [`assert_read_after_commit`],
//! [`assert_exactly_once_convergence`], [`assert_redundancy_outcome`],
//! [`assert_distinct_domains`], [`assert_node_live_during_isolation`]) are regular
//! functions the scenario bodies call; their own non-`#[ignore]`d unit tests run inside
//! `cargo xtask ci`'s `cargo test --workspace`, including **negative controls** (planted
//! anomalies each oracle must CATCH). [`assert_node_live_during_isolation`]'s negative
//! control plants a `"paused"` container state — the falsifiability demonstration for
//! issue #399: if the network-partition leg collapsed back to `docker pause`, this is
//! exactly the (now-caught) input it would produce. Stubbing or removing a helper fails
//! both the unit tests AND the compile-time type-check of the scenario — the
//! born-at-tier seam is load-bearing.
