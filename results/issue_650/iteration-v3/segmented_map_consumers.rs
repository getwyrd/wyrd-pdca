//! Issue #650 (slice 3 of 6 of the #635 re-slicing, 0016 decision 7(e)): **GC and scrub
//! build their reference set through the shared resolver, and both answer honestly over an
//! incomplete one.**
//!
//! The fixture (in-memory trait stores, raw-record `seg:`/root seeding) is adapted from the
//! closed PR's GC/scrub legs, trimmed to what this slice's production code touches —
//! `crates/custodian/src/{gc,scrub,reconciliation,desired_state}.rs`. Restore /
//! reconstruction / rebalance / backfill and their containment legs are #651's; they are not
//! pulled forward, and this file names none of their symbols, so #651 can add its own
//! binding legs without touching it.
//!
//! Every leg drives the real fenced control point
//! [`reconcile_step`](wyrd_custodian::reconcile_step), never a parallel entry — exactly the
//! shape an earlier attempt got wrong (a resolver wired into the read path alone while
//! `gc.rs` kept walking the inline chunk list, so a later GC pass deleted a live segmented
//! object's fragments). The observables are deliberately **positive** — a fragment still on
//! disk, an unrelated fragment genuinely reclaimed, a drain answering `Pending`, a repair
//! obligation actually queued, an audit line naming the record — never "no error was
//! raised", which a pass that did nothing at all also produces.
//!
//! **Why the outcome assertions spell out `!= Satisfied && != Changed` instead of naming the
//! answer:** the third outcome (`Reconciled::Blocked`) is added by the same patch as the fix,
//! so naming it here would make the pre-fix leg a COMPILE error and score a red as a pass.
//! The two base-visible variants are exhaustive before the fix, so excluding both is exactly
//! "the answer this tree cannot give" — assertion-red pre-fix, and no weaker than naming the
//! variant post-fix. The positive matches on `Reconciled::Blocked` and
//! `ReconciliationStatus::PendingUnresolvable` ship in `tests/{gc,scrub,rebalance}.rs`, which
//! the whole-tree gate runs.
//!
//! 1. `segmented_objects_fragments_survive_gc_and_scrub_and_a_drain_answers_pending` —
//!    criterion (1).
//! 2. `one_unreadable_committed_inode_blocks_every_certifying_answer_and_reclaims_nothing` —
//!    criterion (2), including the operator attribution on both audit seams and the
//!    drain-status surface.
//! 3. `one_damaged_object_does_not_end_the_walk_the_rest_of_the_store_is_still_handled` and
//!    `a_structurally_unreadable_committed_root_is_contained_not_propagated` — criterion (3),
//!    over both ways a committed object can be unreadable (its `seg:` records, and its own
//!    root bytes).
//! 4. `a_genuine_store_fault_during_resolve_propagates_rather_than_being_absorbed` — the
//!    other half of criterion (3): a fault that is NOT one object's map still ends the pass.
//! 5. `a_blocked_loop_beside_a_converging_one_still_reports_the_blocked_answer` — the
//!    cross-loop rule: a step never claims more than its weakest loop.
