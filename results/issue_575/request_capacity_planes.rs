//! **The request and capacity planes, observed through their own export surface**
//! (observability floor, proposal 0010 §"Scope boundary" items 4–5; issue #575).
//!
//! The custodian's *durability* plane has been watchable since #450/#527. These two were
//! dark: nothing reported a failing or slow request, and a load-shed was silent — visible
//! only as a client-side `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`, which is to say visible only to whoever kept
//! the client's logs. This file closes that gap by driving the **real roles** and reading the
//! metrics back off `DurabilityTelemetry::gather_prometheus` (`crates/telemetry/src/lib.rs`),
//! the in-process assertion seam 0010 §DST names.
//!
//! **Both planes are driven over a real loopback listener, and that is load-bearing rather
//! than thoroughness.** The instrumentation emits from tonic's and axum's *per-connection
//! spawned tasks* (`tonic-0.14.6` `src/transport/server/mod.rs:925`), and a spawned task does
//! not inherit a scoped `tracing` dispatch. A test that drove the router in-process, on its
//! own task, would pass against wiring that emits **nothing** in production. So each test
//! stands the role up exactly as its CLI entry does — `S3Gateway::with_metrics_dispatch` +
//! `serve` for `wyrd s3` (`cli::serve_s3`), `DServer::with_metrics_dispatch` + `serve` for
//! `wyrd d-server` (`cli::run_d_server`) — and reads back from the same handle the role wired.
//!
//! What is asserted, each separately:
//!
//! 1. [`the_request_plane_records_per_op_latency_for_a_put_and_a_get`] — a PUT and a GET
//!    through the real router over a real `Gateway` backend each land a latency sample under
//!    their own `op` label. The GET's body is **fully drained** first: op completion is
//!    deliberately deferred to body completion (`crates/gateway-s3/src/lib.rs`), because a
//!    duration measured when the head was built would report ~0ms for a transfer that has not
//!    happened yet.
//! 2. [`the_request_plane_counts_a_failing_op_by_op_and_by_the_typed_class`] — a GET whose
//!    backend raises a `wyrd_traits::TransientFault` is counted on
//!    `s3_request_errors{op="get",class="transient"}`. The class is #577's exported value,
//!    consumed — the fault is a real seam type and the gateway runs the seam's own
//!    `classify` over it.
//! 3. [`the_request_plane_classes_a_mid_stream_fault_by_the_seam_not_the_head`] — the same
//!    counter, on the path where the class is hardest to get right: a GET whose head is
//!    already `200` when the fault hits. A class captured at head time can only be the
//!    `Terminal` default there (a streaming head carries no seam error yet), which is the
//!    counter's transient-vs-terminal distinction inverted for exactly the long streaming
//!    reads a real fleet fails on. Test 2 cannot catch it: its fault IS decided at head time.
//! 4. [`the_capacity_plane_reports_admission_and_the_in_flight_gauge_returns_to_zero`] — two
//!    requests held open in the handler raise the admitted counter and drive the in-flight
//!    gauge to 2; releasing them returns it to **0**.
//! 5. [`the_capacity_plane_reports_a_forced_load_shed`] — a request over the server-wide
//!    admission bound is shed, and the shed is an EVENT on the server, not just a status on
//!    the client (0010 PR-sequence item 5 DoD).
//! 6. [`the_capacity_plane_reports_a_request_cut_by_the_request_timeout`] — a handler past
//!    `request_timeout` raises the timed-out counter.
//!
//! RED on the base: none of these metric families exist — no per-op or admission metric is
//! emitted anywhere, and the `s3` / `d-server` roles have no metrics provider at all — so
//! every read-back below finds nothing and every assertion fails.
//!
//! Its own test binary, deliberately: `tracing` caches per-callsite interest in process-global
//! state, so these callsites must not be raced by a no-subscriber sibling (the
//! `custodian_day_one.rs` discipline).
