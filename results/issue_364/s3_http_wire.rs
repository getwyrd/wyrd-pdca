//! The S3 HTTP wire surface, exercised over a real loopback listener (issue #364,
//! m4-first-deployment-blueprint:698-699). An S3 client drives **PUT → GET → DELETE**
//! over the gateway's HTTP listener and asserts:
//!
//! * a **SigV4-signed** round-trip stores and returns the object **byte-identical**
//!   (a multi-chunk object, so the streaming wire path exercises the same chunking the
//!   in-process path does), and DELETE removes it (a later GET is `NoSuchKey`);
//! * an **unsigned** request is refused (403) — no anonymous access — and, crucially, an
//!   unsigned PUT is refused **before its body is read** (a huge declared body that is
//!   never sent still gets a prompt 403), proving auth precedes body materialisation;
//! * a **wrong-signature** request is refused (403) **and stores nothing**;
//! * concurrent **DELETE is idempotent** (both racers succeed; the object ends gone); and
//! * a **stock-SDK `aws-chunked` streaming PUT** (`STREAMING-AWS4-HMAC-SHA256-PAYLOAD`, the
//!   default modern boto3 / aws-sdk wire form) round-trips **byte-identical** and a body
//!   whose chunk signature was tampered is **refused (403)** — the streaming path a real SDK
//!   actually uses, whose chunk-signing algorithm is pinned to AWS's *published* worked
//!   example in `s3::streaming` unit tests, so the interop claim is not self-referential.
//!
//! The request/response bytes are driven by hand over a `TcpStream` so the test controls
//! the exact signed headers (SigV4 is sensitive to header set/order); the signature is
//! produced by the production `sigv4::sign`, whose AWS-correctness — including the
//! **sorted/URI-encoded canonical query** a real SDK sends — is pinned independently by
//! the AWS published-example known-answer unit test (`sigv4::tests`), so a green here is
//! not self-referential. Timestamps are stamped **fresh** (`format_amz_date(now)`) so the
//! signature is inside the freshness/replay window the gateway enforces. RED before the
//! wire surface exists (no `s3` module to bind / dial); GREEN once it does.

/// **Real-SDK interop** (issue #364 carry-forward, iter-5 BLOCKING 3): the recurring reviewer
/// finding was that every wire round-trip here signs with the gateway's *own* `sigv4::sign` and
/// frames with its own streaming helper — a self-referential oracle that hides any divergence
/// from what a genuine AWS client emits. This module closes that gap with the **real Rust
/// `aws-sdk-s3`** as the independent oracle: the SDK's own signer, canonicalizer, and
/// `aws-chunked` framer drive `put_object` → `get_object` → `delete_object` against the
/// gateway's loopback listener, and the object must round-trip **byte-identical**. Nothing in
/// this path calls `crates/server`'s `sigv4`/`streaming` code to build the request, so a green
/// proves AWS-format compatibility (canonicalization, header set, streaming payload framing),
/// not self-consistency.
///
/// It runs under plain `cargo test` (no container): the SDK is pointed at the loopback endpoint
/// with **path-style** addressing, **static** credentials, and a **plaintext** hyper client
/// (the public-TLS terminator is deferred to #367, so the at-Check listener is plaintext
/// loopback). A live boto3 / aws-cli leg stays a pre-declared DEFERRED backstop, not the
/// at-Check bar.
///
/// RED before the wire surface / SigV4 canonicalization is AWS-correct (a real SDK request
/// 403s or its streamed body is stored as framing); GREEN once a stock SDK round-trips.
