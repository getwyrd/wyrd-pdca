# Result — issue 652 / startup-recovery-total-and-bounded

## 1. Spec (from brief.md)              ← Check verifies against THIS
- Defect / goal: `metadata::high_water_marks` is what `Gateway::recover` runs **before the gateway
  serves anything** (`crates/server/src/lib.rs:123-124` on `origin/main`), and it is neither total
  nor bounded — while half of what it computes has no consumer.
  1. **One damaged record stops the gateway from starting.** It decodes every `inode:` value with
     `?` (`crates/core/src/metadata.rs:2081`), so a single undecodable record makes `recover()`
     return `Err` and costs **every healthy object** its availability. #648 enforces the segmented
     root's structural invariants at decode, which widens the set of values that can fail it — so
     this goes from latent to live.
  2. **A store merely too large to scan stops it just as effectively.** All three walks use
     `MetadataStore::scan` (`metadata.rs:2077` `inode:`, `:2094` `pending:`, `:2105` `orphan:`),
     complete-or-fail-loud at `SCAN_CAP` (`crates/traits/src/lib.rs:286` the cap, `:275` "returns
     **no** partial `Vec`", `:288-304` the typed refusal). The bounded-page primitive that exists precisely to
     escape that cap — `scan_page`, merged as #634 / PR #645, commit `18180a2`, *"a page never
     fails with `ScanCapExceeded`: escaping that failure is the method's whole purpose"*
     (`crates/traits/src/lib.rs:1086-1087`) — is not used here.
  3. **The chunk-id half has no caller, and #647 made it silently wrong.** `Gateway::recover`
     discards it (`crates/server/src/lib.rs:124`, `let (max_inode, _max_chunk) = …`), and #647
     grew it into several hundred production lines of byte-level JSON scavenging
     (`RecoveredIds` / `ClassIds` / `torn_digit_escape` / `json_string_token`) carrying its own
     defect: a corrupted flat root such as `{"chunk_map":{"a":1},…}` fails to decode, is classed
     `Optional`, its JSON walk finds no `id` field, and it therefore reports a *complete* reading
     and contributes **0** — turning a fail-closed answer into a silently low floor, the exact
     under-approximation a recovery path must never produce.
- Success criterion: The added test target `crates/server/tests/gateway_recover_totality.rs`
  passes and binds the issue's acceptance, driven through `Gateway::recover()` — whose signature
  `(&self) -> Result<()>` is unchanged by this patch:
  1. **Total over damage.** With a healthy committed object **and** an undecodable raw `inode:<N>`
     value in the same store, `recover()` returns `Ok(())`; the healthy object still reads back
     byte-identically; a subsequent new-key PUT **commits** with an inode id strictly greater
     than `N` (the damaged record's id comes from its **key**, readable even when its value is
     not); and the damaged record is attributed on the audit seam rather than swallowed.
  2. **Total over size.** Against a metadata-store double whose `scan` returns `ScanCapExceeded`
     while `scan_page` works normally, `recover()` still returns `Ok(())` and seeds the same
     floor — i.e. recovery reads its namespaces in bounded pages, never through `scan`.
  3. **The dead half is gone** — the issue's second permitted outcome for the chunk-id floor (see
     *Scope*): `git -C ../wyrd grep -n "_max_chunk" origin/<branch> -- crates/` returns nothing,
     and no `RecoveredIds` / `ClassIds` / byte-scavenging apparatus is introduced.
  4. **No regression on the case `recover` exists for** — the existing
     `recover_seeds_the_allocator_over_a_legacy_store_without_meta_next_inode`
     (`crates/server/tests/s3_http_wire.rs:666-700`) still passes unchanged.
- Repo + branch target: getwyrd/wyrd @ main   (resolved and verified at Plan:
  `git -C ../wyrd ls-remote --heads origin main` → `d50f0ca`, matching the sandbox's
  `origin/main`. Carries #648 (PR #672) and #649/#650 (PR #683), so `high_water_marks` is in its
  post-#648 form — which is what makes defect (1) live.)
- Scope (one logical fix) / out of scope: make **startup recovery** total and bounded, and remove the id-floor half that has no
  caller. `crates/core/src/metadata.rs` — `high_water_marks` walks its namespaces in **bounded
  pages** via the `scan_page` seam instead of `scan`; an `inode:` value it cannot decode is
  **attributed and does not end the walk** (its id still recovered from its *key*).
  `crates/server/src/lib.rs` — `Gateway::recover` and the doc comments describing what recovery
  does and does not recover.

  **Plan decision on the issue's binary ("wire `max_chunk` to a real caller **or** delete it"):
  DELETE — the second outcome, which the issue's acceptance explicitly permits ("the computed
  floor has a real caller, *or the dead half is gone*"). ACCEPTED by the maintainer at Plan,
  2026-08-02 — this is settled, not Do's to revisit.**

  **The decisive fact is history, not analysis: the consumer was already removed, deliberately,
  by `fdd34f1` — "server: make gateway id allocation safe for active-active gateways" (#487,
  2026-07-08, on `main`).** That one commit did both halves:

  - *before it*, `mint_chunk_id` was `ChunkId::from(self.next_chunk.fetch_add(1, …))` — a plain
    sequential counter starting at 0 — and `recover()` **consumed** the floor:
    `let next_chunk = u64::try_from(max_chunk)…saturating_add(1); self.next_chunk.fetch_max(…)`.
    The floor was genuinely load-bearing then;
  - *after it*, the id is `(chunk_epoch << 64) | seq` with the epoch's top bit set, so every
    minted id is **≥ 2^127** (`crates/server/src/lib.rs:238-241`, `:257-263`). Disjointness
    between processes now comes from the **random per-process epoch**, not from a recovered
    floor — which is why `next_chunk_seq` is `AtomicU64::new(0)` (`lib.rs:104`) and is **never
    seeded from anything**. #487 orphaned the floor in the same commit, rewriting the callsite to
    `let (max_inode, _max_chunk) = …` (`lib.rs:124`).

  So this slice removes **dead code left behind by #487**, not a safety property: the tree has
  been running without a consumed chunk-id floor since 2026-07-08. The second minter never
  needed it either — `cli::chunk_id_minter` yields `(inode_id << 64) | seq`
  (`crates/server/src/cli.rs:1716-1723`) and `alloc_inode` returns **1** on an empty store
  (`cli.rs:1656`, `None => 1`) and only increments, so `inode_id ≥ 1` and every cluster-path id
  is **≥ 2^64**; it resumes from the persisted `meta:next_inode` counter that the **inode** mark —
  the half this slice keeps — already seeds. Nothing in the tree mints into the `< 2^64`
  in-process space the floor guards (`IN_PROCESS_CHUNK_CEILING`, `metadata.rs:2074`); the tree's
  own doc says so at `lib.rs:250-251`. Wiring would mean inventing a consumer.

  The chunk-id mark therefore goes, and with it the `pending:` and `orphan:` walks that exist only
  to compute it (`metadata.rs:2094`, `:2105`) — two fewer unbounded `scan` calls at startup, which
  serves this slice's own "total and bounded" goal. Acceptance bullet 1 (floor ≥ every live chunk
  id, `seg:` ranges included) is discharged **by construction** rather than by a stronger
  implementation.

  **Delete the standing test with it — and say why in the commit.**
  `high_water_marks_refuses_a_segmented_root_rather_than_re_mint_its_chunk_ids`
  (`crates/core/src/metadata.rs:3417`) reasons that "a segmented root read as 'owns no chunks'
  would contribute nothing to `max_chunk`, so the next PUT could mint an id that object's
  fragments already occupy". That premise **expired with #487**: the scenario needs a minter
  allocating below 2^64, and neither minter has since 2026-07-08. It is a durability-shaped test
  whose hazard is unreachable, and removing it will read as deleting a safety guard unless the
  reasoning above travels with it — state it in `build-notes.md` **and** the commit body. Its
  live half (a segmented root must not silently under-count) is not lost: it is superseded by
  criterion (1), which requires the walk to be total over records it cannot read at all.

  **Out of scope:** any change to the chunk-id **minting** scheme (ADR-0019 / #487 — settled;
  changing it is a new ADR, INTEGRATION §2/§4); the maintenance passes (#650/#651); the committer
  (#653); any new/edited ADR / spec / proposal; any conformance-vector change; **any docs
  paragraph** — the living-architecture edits belong to #648 (record shape), #649–#651
  (resolver/containment) and #653 (staged publication), and #647's sentences about deriving an
  id-allocator floor from segment records describe behaviour this slice removes.
