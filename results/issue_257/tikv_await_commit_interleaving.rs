//! **Determinism-gap coverage seed** (M4.6, #257; proposal 0015 §"Pinning the trait with
//! the second implementation"; ADR-0009; ADR-0015 commit-point contract; **ADR-0039
//! Option-B posture**).
//!
//! # Honest scope — read this before trusting the assertions below
//!
//! This seed is **pure redb coverage**. It carries **NO correctness weight for
//! `TikvMetadataStore::commit`**, and a production regression in the TiKV commit path
//! **cannot** turn it red. Do **not** grade it as evidence that the redb→TiKV metadata swap
//! upholds any contract. That evidence lives entirely **off-Check** (the live Tier-1
//! consistency scenario on a real ≥3-replica TiKV cluster —
//! `crates/metadata-tikv/tests/tier1_metadata_consistency.rs`, the `WYRD_TIER1` job).
//!
//! ## Why it cannot have TiKV teeth at Check (the Option-B reason, ratified)
//!
//! The binding oracle the brief's direction (a) wanted was the **real, unchanged
//! `TikvMetadataStore::commit` driven over a deterministic third-party sim**. That is
//! **unreachable at Check**, for two independent, checkable reasons:
//!
//! 1. **`madsim-tikv-client` does not exist.** `cargo search madsim-tikv-client` returns no
//!    release tracking `tikv-client = "0.4"` (confirmed at build). There is no third-party
//!    deterministic TiKV to alias in, the way `crates/chunkstore-grpc/Cargo.toml` aliases
//!    `madsim-tonic` for the gRPC path (proposal 0004).
//! 2. **The store is not injectable.** `TikvMetadataStore` holds a **concrete**
//!    `tikv_client::TransactionClient` (`crates/metadata-tikv/src/lib.rs:420-421`), built
//!    only by `connect(pd_endpoints)` → `TransactionClient::new(..).await`
//!    (`crates/metadata-tikv/src/lib.rs:435-436`) — it needs a **real cluster** and is not
//!    generic over a fake client. Making it injectable would require editing
//!    `crates/metadata-tikv/src`, which the slice's invariant forbids byte-for-byte
//!    (proposal 0015; ADR-0006).
//!
//! So the real TiKV **await-inside-`commit()` percolator window** — the interleaving between
//! the precondition re-read `get_for_update` (`crates/metadata-tikv/src/lib.rs:560`) and the
//! terminal `txn.commit().await` (`crates/metadata-tikv/src/lib.rs:597`) — is verified only
//! against a real cluster, off-Check. This seed runs over **redb**, whose `commit()` is
//! internally synchronous (one write transaction, no `await` inside), so it exhibits **no
//! interleaving that `concurrency.rs` does not already cover** and **no newly-reachable
//! interleaving** of any kind.
//!
//! # The determinism-gap fact — asserted where it is checkable (off-Check), conceded here
//!
//! The brief's Option-B line asks the seed to assert "the `concurrency.rs` synchronous-commit
//! rationale is unsound; here is a newly-reachable interleaving". That rationale
//! (`crates/dst/tests/concurrency.rs:3-4`, "each `commit()` is internally synchronous … no
//! await inside") is indeed **false for `TikvMetadataStore::commit`**, which awaits network
//! I/O across its precondition/commit window (`crates/metadata-tikv/src/lib.rs:540-600`). But
//! that unsoundness is a property **only redb-vs-TiKV divergence can exhibit** — it is not
//! observable in a redb-only test, and (per the two reasons above) not drivable at Check.
//! This seed therefore **explicitly concedes that assertion off-Check**: the newly-reachable
//! interleaving and the demonstration that the `concurrency.rs` rationale does not carry over
//! to TiKV are exercised by the live Tier-1 consistency scenario against a real cluster
//! (`crates/metadata-tikv/tests/tier1_metadata_consistency.rs`; `WYRD_TIER1` job). At Check,
//! the seed makes no such claim.
//!
//! # What it *does* add over `concurrency.rs` (honest, redb-only)
//!
//! `concurrency.rs::exactly_one_concurrent_writer_wins` counts *winners* only — it never
//! asserts how the losers are classified. This seed adds the narrow, honest redb assertion
//! that the loser of a concurrent overwrite CAS is classified **precisely as
//! `CommitOutcome::Conflict`** (a re-readable lost race), not a silent overwrite and not an
//! opaque `Err`. That is a real property of the trait contract redb implements — and the one
//! the TiKV backend must also implement behind the unchanged trait — but the *check here* is
//! against **redb**, and only redb.
//!
//! # Determinism / execution
//!
//! The redb assertion holds under **every** madsim seed the `cargo xtask dst` sweep runs (it
//! is a property of the CAS contract, not a lucky schedule). Executed at Check by
//! `cargo xtask ci` → `run_dst` under `--cfg madsim` (`xtask/src/main.rs`). Requires
//! `--cfg madsim`; without it this file compiles to nothing (matching `concurrency.rs`), so a
//! plain `cargo test` neither builds nor runs it.
