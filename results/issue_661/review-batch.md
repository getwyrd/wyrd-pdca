# Batched review — 3 passes, union of findings

No untriaged findings survive (all either absent, noise-dropped, or recorded-rejected).

Triage rule: every finding above must be fixed (it then leaves the next run) or recorded-rejected in the decisions file ($PDCA_BUNDLE/review-rejected.md) as `<file:line> | <CLASS> | <MATCH> | <reason>`, where MATCH is a phrase from the finding's rationale — not re-reviewed to silence. The gate blocks while any finding here is unchecked.
