//! Reactor-liveness regression for `FsChunkStore`'s async `ChunkStore` methods
//! (issue #204).
//!
//! `FsChunkStore` implements the **async** `ChunkStore` trait, but its method
//! bodies are synchronous blocking `std::fs` syscalls. The d-server hosts the
//! store on a multi-threaded tokio runtime and dispatches each storage RPC as a
//! task; if a method runs its syscall directly on the reactor worker thread, that
//! thread is **pinned for the whole syscall** and every other task on the runtime
//! is starved — including the lease-renew heartbeat, whose missed tick past the
//! lease TTL drops the server out of discovery.
//!
//! This test makes that starvation observable on a **constrained** runtime: a
//! single worker thread, with a co-scheduled timer task and a burst of storage
//! I/O (`list_fragments`, the O(N) walk that is the worst starvation source). Both
//! the timer and the burst are spawned **tasks on the one worker**, so they share
//! that worker cooperatively:
//!
//!   * Before the fix — the burst runs every `list_fragments` walk synchronously
//!     on the worker and never yields, so it monopolises the single worker for the
//!     whole burst; the timer task cannot be polled and makes **zero** progress
//!     while the I/O is in flight.
//!   * After the fix — each walk is offloaded to tokio's blocking pool, so the
//!     worker is free between awaits; the timer task interleaves and keeps ticking
//!     while the I/O runs.
//!
//! We assert the timer advanced *during* the burst. `list_fragments` only parses
//! directory-entry names (it never reads file contents), so the store is populated
//! with empty `.frag` files directly — no fragment encoding needed — keeping the
//! unit under test import-light (no GUI / display) and safe on a headless runner.
