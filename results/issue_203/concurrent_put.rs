//! Concurrency regression for `FsChunkStore::put_fragment` (issue #203).
//!
//! Many writers racing on the **same** `FragmentId` must all succeed: each uses
//! a private scratch file and publishes via an atomic rename, so no writer can
//! observe or clobber another's partial bytes and none fails spuriously. Before
//! the fix the scratch path was keyed on the `FragmentId` alone (`<index>.tmp`)
//! and shared across calls; concurrent same-id writes raced on it and the second
//! `fs::rename` could hit `NotFound`, spuriously erroring a legitimate
//! duplicate/repair write.
//!
//! The store's I/O is synchronous (`std::fs`), so real OS threads driving
//! `pollster::block_on` give genuine concurrency without an async runtime; a
//! `Barrier` releases every writer at once to widen the write→rename race. The
//! load is import-light (no GUI / display / async runtime), so it is safe on a
//! headless runner. Per-write scratch *uniqueness* is also asserted structurally
//! in the crate's unit tests
//! (`scratch_names_are_unique_per_seq_and_invisible_to_listing`); this test is
//! the behavioural half — every concurrent put returns `Ok`.
