//! Issue #648, slice 1/6 of the #635 re-slicing (0016 decision 7(a)): the segmented
//! chunk-map **record shape and its codec** — `ChunkMap::{Flat, Segmented}`, the
//! decode-time structural invariants, and the `seg:`/`seggrp:` key helpers. This
//! slice lands no resolver and no producer (#649 onward); it binds entirely through
//! **base-visible** API (`wyrd_core::metadata::{encode, decode, InodeRecord}`) over
//! **raw stored bytes**.
//!
//! Every segmented case here is a hand-authored JSON byte string, decoded through
//! `decode::<InodeRecord>`. This file therefore imports nothing this patch adds
//! (no `ChunkMap`, `SegmentedMap`, `SegmentRef`, `SegmentGroup`, `seg_key`,
//! `ChunkMapError`, …) — only symbols already visible on `origin/main`. On a revert
//! of `crates/core/src/metadata.rs` (the RED leg), `chunk_map` is back to a bare
//! `Vec<ChunkRef>`, so this file still COMPILES (it names nothing new) and instead
//! fails as an **assertion**: a segmented root's raw bytes no longer decode
//! (criterion 2's positive case and criterion 3 both fail as assertions), which is
//! the falsifiability this test binds — never a compile error.
//!
//! The one place a number from the patched module is needed — criterion 3's
//! `MAX_ROOT_SEGMENTS`, `MAX_VALUE_BYTES` and the `MAX_ROOT_VALUE_BYTES` budget the
//! table is sized against (`0016:1467`) — reads it out of the module's **source text**
//! ([`production_constant`]) instead of copying it, so the ceiling this test measures is
//! the ceiling that ships, and a later slice moving any of those constants is judged
//! here rather than in production.
//!
//! Criterion 3 is then asserted against an upper bound over **every** root at that
//! segment count ([`encoded_upper_bound`]) rather than against one hand-built table:
//! "the worst case" is a maximisation nobody should have to win by hand — equal spans
//! are not it ([`front_loaded_table`] beats them by 387 bytes at 641 segments) — and a
//! capacity test that measures only its author's guess can pass while the shape that
//! ships is over budget.
