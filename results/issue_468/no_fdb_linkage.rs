//! **No `libfdb_c` in the simulator's dependency graph** — the mechanical guarantee that
//! backs the simulated-FDB model (issue #468).
//!
//! `crates/dst` is the deterministic-simulation tier (ADR-0009). The `foundationdb` crate
//! binds `libfdb_c` through `foundationdb-sys`, and `libfdb_c` **spawns its own network
//! thread** and does real, non-deterministic I/O — `ensure_network()` boots it behind a
//! process-wide `OnceLock` (`crates/metadata-fdb/src/lib.rs:846-869`). Linking it into a DST
//! build target would violate seed determinism outright (ADR-0035; the rejection is recorded
//! at `crates/dst/tests/support/mod.rs:6-8`). So the FDB backend is **modelled**
//! (`support::SimFdbMetadataStore`), never linked.
//!
//! ## Linkage is a graph property, not a manifest-text property
//!
//! The obvious guard — grep this crate's `Cargo.toml` for `foundationdb` — is wrong in both
//! directions, and this crate's own manifest proves it:
//!
//! * **It misses.** `crates/dst/Cargo.toml:56,66,68` already declares `tonic`, `etcd-client`
//!   and `tokio` in Cargo's **rename** form (`name = { package = "real-name", … }`). A line
//!   reading `fdb = { package = "foundationdb", … }` links `libfdb_c` into every DST test
//!   binary while never spelling the needle where a key-name scan would look. So does a
//!   **transitive** edge: a dependency that itself depends on `foundationdb`.
//! * **It over-reaches.** `foundationdb` is optional behind `wyrd-metadata-fdb`'s
//!   default-**off** `fdb` feature (`crates/metadata-fdb/Cargo.toml:11-22`), so a bare
//!   `wyrd-metadata-fdb` dependency would trip a name scan without linking `libfdb_c` at all.
//!
//! What actually decides whether `libfdb_c` is linked is the **feature-unified resolved
//! dependency graph** of the `wyrd-dst` package — the thing `cargo tree -e features` prints,
//! and the thing cargo itself builds from. So that is what is asserted here, with a
//! **planted red** carrying both blind spots (the rename form *and* a transitive edge) to
//! prove the scanner catches what a text scan cannot.
//!
//! ## The graph is resolved under a forced `--cfg madsim`, not the ambient one
//!
//! The `libfdb_c` risk lives in `[target.'cfg(madsim)'.dev-dependencies]`
//! (`crates/dst/Cargo.toml:55`) — the section this manifest puts its renamed madsim deps in
//! (`tonic`, `etcd-client`, `tokio`), and the section a real FDB dep would be added to in the
//! same house style. `cargo tree` resolves that section **only** when `--cfg madsim` is in the
//! effective `RUSTFLAGS`. That is true under `cargo xtask dst`/`run_dst()`, but **NOT** under
//! `run-verify.sh`'s bare `cargo test -p wyrd-dst --test no_fdb_linkage` (this file is
//! deliberately not `#![cfg(madsim)]`-gated, so it must also run there). Inheriting the ambient
//! cfg would leave the invariant blind to the real-risk section under exactly the bare
//! invocation it must also run in — the gap the iteration-2 carry-forward flagged. So the guard
//! **forces `RUSTFLAGS=--cfg madsim`** for the linkage scan (the madsim graph is a superset of
//! the bare one for the FDB question), and the planted red proves the point in both directions:
//! the `cfg(madsim)`-gated FDB node is caught under `--cfg madsim` and invisible without it, so
//! forcing the cfg is demonstrably load-bearing, not decorative.
//!
//! Three assertions, all cheap, all deterministic, all run by `cargo xtask ci` (via
//! `run_dst()`):
//!
//! 1. **The linkage invariant.** No `foundationdb` / `foundationdb-sys` package node in
//!    `wyrd-dst`'s feature-unified graph — with **two** demonstrated reds proving the scanner
//!    works rather than resting green on non-existence (the shape of
//!    `xtask/tests/deploy_no_orchestrator_coupling.rs:67`): a planted fixture carrying the
//!    rename form and a transitive edge, and the **real** `foundationdb 0.10` dependency,
//!    surfaced by turning on `wyrd-metadata-fdb`'s default-off `fdb` feature.
//! 2. **The policy invariant.** `crates/dst/Cargo.toml` names neither `wyrd-metadata-fdb`
//!    nor `foundationdb` — including in the rename and quoted-section forms. Strictly
//!    stronger than (1) as a *policy* (the FDB crate must not even be named here, so nobody
//!    can flip the feature on later) and strictly weaker as *evidence of linkage*, which is
//!    why (1) exists and is the one this file's title claims.
//! 3. **The model exists.** `crates/dst/tests/support/mod.rs` declares the simulated-FDB
//!    store with its ambiguity nemesis and its `MetadataStore` impl. A structural assertion,
//!    stated plainly: it pins the *seam*, not the behaviour. The behavioural red→green for
//!    the commit-ambiguity property lives in `crates/dst/tests/commit_ambiguity.rs`, which
//!    only executes under `--cfg madsim`.
//!
//! ## Why `cargo tree` and not a TOML parse
//!
//! `crates/dst` has no `toml`/`serde` dependency. Adding one would trip ADR-0003 §2's
//! three-test dependency audit and the `deny.toml` allowlist. `cargo` is already present —
//! it is running this test — and it is the *authority* on feature unification, which no
//! single-manifest parse can reconstruct anyway.
//!
//! Unlike its sibling `commit_ambiguity.rs`, this file is deliberately **not**
//! `#![cfg(madsim)]`-gated, so it also runs under a bare
//! `cargo test -p wyrd-dst --test no_fdb_linkage`.
