//! The FoundationDB dev/CI harness (issue #439, ADR-0042).
//!
//! The `fdb` backend is the *chosen production metadata backend*, yet before this slice
//! nothing invoked `cargo xtask fdb-conformance` (`xtask/src/main.rs`), no CI job ran it,
//! the merge gate never compiled the `fdb` feature, and a developer with no `libfdb_c`
//! got a raw linker error. This test is the Check-time evidence for the three artifacts
//! that close those gaps — and it runs on a **plain worktree**: no Docker, no `libfdb_c`,
//! default toolchain. That is deliberate. The whole point of the slice is that the merge
//! gate stays container-free (ADR-0016), so its regression test must be too.
//!
//! What is asserted, mirroring the two peer patterns the brief names:
//!
//! 1. **`xtask::fdb_doctor` is a pure, non-privileged module** mapping each probe outcome
//!    to a verdict + a remediation that names the concrete package / variable / command.
//! 2. **Demonstrated REDs**, not greens resting on non-existence
//!    (`xtask/tests/deploy_no_orchestrator_coupling.rs:67`'s planted-import pattern):
//!    a planted failing probe outcome flips the doctor's verdict; a planted comment-only
//!    workflow yields no executed commands; a planted ungated conformance body is caught.
//! 3. **The preflight call site** — `run_gated_conformance` *is* the body of
//!    `run_fdb_conformance`, and every branch of it is driven here with the container
//!    stack injected as a recording closure, so "the preflight never runs" is a red.
//! 4. **The workflow ↔ dispatch contract** — every `cargo xtask <sub>` the workflow
//!    **executes** (scraped from its `run:` scripts, never from prose) is a subcommand
//!    `xtask/src/main.rs` really dispatches; its pull-request path filter covers the
//!    backend *and* the server; and the `--features fdb` type-checks it runs on the PR
//!    leg are `xtask::feature_gated_checks(false, true)` verbatim.
//! 5. **`xtask::feature_gated_checks(tikv, fdb)`** yields the two `--features fdb`
//!    type-checks when `fdb` is on and not when it is off, *independently of `tikv`* —
//!    the coupling hazard that forced the two explicit parameters.
//!
//! The doctor's impure half is split by whether it can be driven headlessly. The
//! client-library adapter, `fdb_doctor::probe_client_library_live`, lives in the lib and is
//! driven END-TO-END here against a real `FDB_CLIENT_LIB_PATH` and a real temp file
//! (`the_live_client_library_adapter_reads_the_real_env_and_filesystem`), so the two
//! effect-discarding mutations the re-plan names flip Check red. The cluster-file and
//! cluster-health probes (which read `/etc/foundationdb` and spawn `fdbcli`) stay in
//! `xtask/src/main.rs` and are exercised for real by the nightly
//! `.github/workflows/fdb-conformance.yml` job. What is asserted here is the decision logic
//! those probes feed — the same functions production calls.
