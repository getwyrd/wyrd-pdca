//! Server-side FDB metadata-backend selection (issue #440, ADR-0042 "selection is
//! not deployment", `docs/design/adr/0042-production-metadata-backend-reevaluation.md:463`).
//! #438 landed the `wyrd-metadata-fdb` driver (PR #492), but no `server`-side
//! selection arm reached it: `--metadata-backend fdb` was rejected as unknown. This
//! is a **NEW file** (not an edit to `backend_selection.rs`) so `C4-verify`'s
//! `_added_files` / `ADDED_TESTS` discrimination sees it as an added test and the
//! RED phase is genuine (see brief "Test file" note).
//!
//! Three binding assertions, all message-content (not `is_err()` — pre-fix
//! `from_config(Some("fdb"))` already returns `Err`, just with the wrong text):
//!
//! 1. `#[cfg(not(feature = "fdb"))]`-gated: the default build rejects `fdb` with a
//!    build-hint mentioning `--features fdb`, mirroring the tikv text (`cli.rs:117`).
//! 2. `from_config(Some("nonsense"))`'s message must itself mention `fdb` — proof the
//!    unknown-value text lists all three backends, not just two.
//! 3. The compiled binary's no-args usage (stderr) lists `redb|tikv|fdb`.

// This patch declares the `fdb` feature (`crates/server/Cargo.toml:31`), so with the fix
// applied `feature = "fdb"` is a known cfg value and this allow is inert. It exists for
// the ONE tree where the feature is not declared: `C4-verify`'s RED phase, which reverts
// every modified file — `crates/server/Cargo.toml` included
// (`engine/scripts/run-verify.sh:264`) — while keeping this added test (`:260`). Without
// the allow, the RED would be a *compile* error (`unexpected_cfgs`, hardened into an error
// by the sibling `warnings = "deny"`, `Cargo.toml:195-196`), proving only "the crate does
// not build"; with it, the RED is three genuine assertion failures on message content,
// which is what the regression contract is actually about. The allow cannot hide a typo'd
// cfg value: each gated test appears by name in exactly one of the two runs recorded in
// build-notes (default build vs `--features fdb`), so a misspelling would show up there as
// a missing test name.
