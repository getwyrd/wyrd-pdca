//! The atomic-commit **conflict semantics under contention** for FoundationDB (ADR-0042).
//! Where `tests/conformance.rs` exercises the *sequential* CAS clauses of the shared
//! suite, this suite forces a real server-side **lost race** over a live `fdbserver` and
//! pins the load-bearing partition of the commit contract
//! (`crates/traits/src/lib.rs:346-350`; the rule TiKV reproduces at
//! `crates/metadata-tikv/src/lib.rs:542-546`):
//!
//! * a **conditional** batch (one carrying preconditions) that loses a race on a
//!   `require`d key is `Ok(CommitOutcome::Conflict)`, never `Err` — FDB signals it with
//!   error **1020 `not_committed`**, and the caller (e.g. `alloc_inode`'s budgeted backoff
//!   loop, `crates/server/src/cli.rs:1027-1049`) decides whether to retry;
//! * a **blind** batch (no preconditions) is **never** `Conflict`. It has no precondition
//!   to have failed, so a commit failure surfaces as `Err` — the many callers that `?` the
//!   result and ignore the `CommitOutcome` would otherwise read `Conflict` as success and
//!   silently drop the write.
//!
//! **This binary is the live witness for the first clause only.** The 1020 → `Conflict`
//! classification is genuinely exercised here, on a real error from a real server. The
//! second clause — "a blind batch is never `Conflict`" — cannot be witnessed live, and this
//! file does not pretend otherwise: FoundationDB never rejects a write-only transaction
//! (empty read-conflict set), so no blind commit error ever reaches the classifier. What
//! this suite contributes to that clause is its *premise*, grounded against the server
//! (`blind_write_race_never_reports_conflict`), plus a real blind commit **fault** surfacing
//! as `Err` (`blind_batch_commit_error_surfaces_as_err_never_conflict`).
//!
//! The clause itself, and the `1021 commit_unknown_result` rule (which means the client lost
//! contact after sending the commit, and which no healthy cluster emits on demand), are
//! pinned in `crates/metadata-fdb/src/lib.rs` (`store::tests`) on the production routing
//! rule, retry gate, and exhaustion error. `xtask fdb-conformance` runs them as its `--lib`
//! leg. A live test could only have re-asserted the pure classifier — green whatever the
//! blind path actually does with the error.
//!
//! The run is **cluster-file-gated**, identical to `tests/conformance.rs`: with no
//! `WYRD_FDB_CLUSTER_FILE` set it **skips cleanly** so `cargo xtask ci` stays green;
//! `cargo xtask fdb-conformance` brings up the throwaway `deploy/fdb-single-node` cluster,
//! sets the cluster file, rebuilds with `--features fdb`, and runs it for real.
