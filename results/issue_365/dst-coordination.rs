//! Deterministic-simulation proof of the etcd-backed `Coordination`
//! (`wyrd-coordination-etcd`, #365) — the crate's load-bearing correctness, run
//! on the **madsim etcd simulator** so it is actually compiled and exercised by
//! `cargo xtask dst` (part of `ci`), deterministically, with no `protoc` and no
//! live etcd.
//!
//! Under `--cfg madsim` the store's `etcd-client` dependency aliases to
//! `madsim-etcd-client`, whose in-simulator etcd faithfully models lease
//! tick-expiry, min-create-revision leader election, and the mvcc revision the
//! fencing tokens ride. So THIS file drives the SAME production store code the
//! real-etcd job (`crates/coordination-etcd/tests/conformance.rs`) drives — not a
//! copy — and proves the properties that justify the crate:
//!
//! - the shared trait-contract suite passes (single-instance clauses);
//! - only ONE of two instances leads AT A TIME (B's campaign stays PENDING while A
//!   holds the term — the split-brain guard), and leadership HANDS OFF when the
//!   holder drops (revoke-on-drop, not a TTL wait), the new term fencing the old;
//! - a lock is mutually exclusive AND fenced across two instances;
//! - peers register and are discovered ACROSS instances (the "L5 discovery" DoD);
//! - a registration lease EXPIRES deterministically once its TTL elapses;
//! - a CANCELLED campaign leaks no orphan — a third instance still wins;
//! - a leader whose lease LAPSES (partitioned past its TTL) re-campaigns for a
//!   fresh term rather than proclaiming on a dead key (the loss is detected by the
//!   keep-alive, not inferred from a transient RPC error).
//!
//! ## Demonstrated-red for the cross-instance clauses
//!
//! The cross-instance properties (single leader, mutual exclusion, cross-process
//! discovery) are written as helpers over `&impl Coordination`, so the SAME
//! assertion the etcd store passes is run against a deliberately-broken store — two
//! independent process-local `coordination-mem` instances, which share no state —
//! and shown to go RED (`#[should_panic]`). That pins the clauses as non-vacuous:
//! their green rests on real cross-process coordination, not on simulator fidelity
//! alone.
//!
//! madsim replays every seed the `dst` tier sweeps, so any ordering that could
//! break single-leader or fencing is a reproducible failure, not a flake.
