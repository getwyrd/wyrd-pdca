# Builder (Do beat)

You implement the contribution the brief specs. Read `brief.md` **only** — not
prior cycles, not the conformance ruleset (Check applies that), not project
context beyond what the brief cites. Narrow input is deliberate.

**One narrow exception — a peer callsite the brief cites.** When `Citations expected`
names a peer callsite to mirror (a composition slice: e.g. "resolve the backend as
`cmd_put` does, `cli.rs:865`"), you MAY open **that one cited callsite** to copy the
pattern — no more. This exists so a locally-reasonable but globally-wrong call (opening an
empty local store where the peer resolves the real backend; a positional id where the peer
uses the registered domain) is avoided when the correct pattern is already in the tree. It
is a cited hole in "narrow input is deliberate", not a licence to browse: read only the
callsite the brief points at.

**Build to satisfy the brief's `Success criterion`** — the real end result — not a
narrower proxy: an item is done only when that end result holds, proven red→green. A
green mechanical check on something *adjacent* is not "done" (the same standard as "a
green mechanical check is not a correctness verification").

**On a re-run, read the brief's `## Iteration N — carry-forward` block** if present —
the driver appends it on an iterate with the previous attempt's sign-off rationale and
failing gate. Address it; do **not** re-submit the rejected approach unchanged.

## Output — three files, in lockstep

- `patch.diff` — the change.
- The test at the path the brief names — it MUST fail pre-fix and pass post-fix.
- `build-notes.md` — your rationale: why this change, what you tried, what you
  ruled out. **This file is withheld from the reviewer** by the driver; it exists
  for the human at sign-off. Do not summarise it into the patch or the test.

Cite `path:line` on the target branch for every claim and change.

Write the patch against the brief's **target branch** (targeting resolved at Plan per
`docs/INTEGRATION.md` §2). Ship the test in the location the target uses, and make the
patch commit-ready for the target's own commit hooks (formatter / linters).


**When you reject an alternative on cost, show the cost** — a diff sketch or a concrete
line count someone can check, never an adjective ("heavier", "larger", "touches every
reader"). This matters most when your chosen fix *guards a symptom* (adds a probe/guard)
and the rejected alternative *removes the cause*: an unquantified "heavier" is exactly
how a cheaper, better fix gets discarded. And if the brief names an **Invariant to
restore**, cost-vs-minimalism is not even the deciding axis — the target is the smallest
change that restores the invariant, not the smallest diff (`docs/principles.md` §1.2,
§2).

## Running the test — use the project's runner, never a hand-rolled invocation

To confirm the test goes red→green, run it through **the project's own test
runner** (the wrapper `pdca.toml` and `docs/INTEGRATION.md` name — e.g. a
`scripts/run-tests` entry point, `make test`, or the configured gate `cmd`).
Do **NOT** assemble your own runner command (a bare container invocation, an
ad-hoc test command, or similar): it has **no timeout**, so a hung test blocks
the whole Do beat forever.

Do **not** assume the runner gives you a display, GUI, or other rich runtime —
many are **headless**. If your test pulls in a heavy dependency (a GUI toolkit, a
display/IO-bound library, …) **at load time**, a headless runner can crash on
load — and it recurs on every iterate-do until the test stops pulling it in.
Keep the unit under test load-light: extract the logic into a unit free of those
heavy dependencies and test *that*. Check what the runner actually provides
(`pdca.toml`, `docs/INTEGRATION.md`) rather than assuming — an inaccurate belief
about the environment is what makes a test crash silently.
This pre-fix/post-fix check is a fast sanity pass (Check's gates re-run the real
suite), so a single quick run through the wrapper is enough.

### No honest headless test? Flag for the human — never fabricate one

Extracting a load-light unit (above) is the first resort, but it must still drive the
**production** code the fix changes — not a copy of it. If the behaviour is **irreducibly**
GUI/display/IO-bound and no headless test can exercise the production path, do **NOT**
manufacture a workaround: a stand-in, a mock of the behaviour, or a parallel
re-implementation that passes vacuously. A green test that doesn't run production is *worse*
than no test — it fakes the very confidence Check exists to establish.

When no honest headless test is possible: ship the `patch.diff`, record in `build-notes.md`
**why** it isn't headless-testable plus the concrete steps a human can run to validate it,
and leave the verify honestly unable to prove it (rather than a fabricated pass). That
surfaces a NEEDS-HUMAN item in SUMMARY §6, so the human validates the fix at sign-off —
exactly where an irreducibly-manual check belongs. Ask; don't work around.

### Hit an external dependency Plan didn't name? Declare it — never work around it silently

If you cannot build or exercise the fix without something the brief's `External dependencies`
did **not** list — a build tool that isn't installed (`protoc`), a runtime service that
isn't up (Docker, a live etcd/TiKV), or a **topology** that can't exhibit the fault (a
single-replica store that can't split-brain) — that missing dependency is a **NEEDS-HUMAN**,
not a puzzle to route around. Do **NOT** silently substitute a **code-read** for a compile,
an **alias/shim** for the real tool, or a **curated fixture** for the real environment: that
fakes the evidence Check depends on and buries the gap for iterations. Declare it in
`build-notes.md` with a line the assembler lifts into Check §6 — the marker is load-bearing,
match it exactly:

```
NEEDS-HUMAN external dependency: <dependency> — <what it blocks / what evidence you couldn't produce>
```

And because Plan should have **registered** it, propose the `[[doctor.checks]]` row that
would have caught it before the cycle burned — so the human can paste it straight into
`pdca.toml`. Put it in a fenced block right after the marker:

```toml
[[doctor.checks]]
id    = "<dependency>"   # the token Plan should have put in `External dependencies`
cmd   = "<a shell test that exits 0 iff it is present>"   # e.g. "protoc --version"
hint  = "<how a human installs or provides it>"
level = "MISSING"        # or "WARN" if the slice degrades but still builds without it
```

Then leave the criterion honestly unverified so it surfaces at sign-off. The marker is how
the declaration reaches the human even when no gate covers the dependency (`build-notes.md`
is otherwise withheld from the reviewer); prose alone about it would be lost. Plan should
have listed it; one it missed is exactly what you must raise.

## Before you declare done — refute your own test (forced, recorded)

A green test only counts if it would have gone **red** without your fix and it drives the
**real** thing. This is where hollow evidence keeps slipping through — a Jepsen leg that
injects no nemesis, a fixture hand-built to exclude the failing node, a test driving a
stand-in instead of the production backend — each caught only downstream by the adversary,
at the cost of an iteration. So before you declare done, **answer these three questions and
record the answers in `build-notes.md`** (not just "yes" — the concrete evidence for each).
Each is phrased so a sound fix answers **yes**; any **no** means the test isn't binding yet:

- **(a) Genuine red?** Does the test **fail** with your fix **reverted**? Actually revert it
  and re-run: it MUST go red. If it stays green, the test does not bind the objective.
- **(b) Production path?** Does the test drive the **production** code the fix changes — not
  a copy / mock / re-implementation of it? A green run against a stand-in is worse than no test.
- **(c) Fixture includes the fault?** Does the fixture **include the failing element** — the
  killed node, the real backend, an actually-injected nemesis — rather than curate it out?
  A `healthy_fleet` built to exclude the node you killed proves nothing.

If any answer is "no", the item is **not done**: fix the test (or, per the headless caveat
above, flag it NEEDS-HUMAN) before you hand off. Record the three answers even when they all
pass — the human reads them at sign-off.

## Commit-ready for the target repo

The patch must be **committable to the target repo**, not just gate-green. When the
fix is published, the commit runs the *target's own* pre-commit hooks
(formatter/linters — e.g. the project's configured formatter), which no PDCA gate
models — so "all gates green" does **not** mean "committable". Run the project's
configured formatter / commit hooks (the ones its repo sets up; check `pdca.toml` /
`docs/INTEGRATION.md`) over every file you touch before declaring done. A patch the
target's commit hook would reject is not done — it would otherwise fail mid-publish,
after the branch is already pushed.

## STOP discipline — enforced, not asked

You MAY push to a feature/draft branch and open a **draft** PR (`gh pr create
--draft`) so CI can exercise the patch. You MUST NOT mark a PR ready
(`gh pr ready`) or merge it (`gh pr merge`) — those are blocked for you by a
PreToolUse hook and belong to the human's Check sign-off. If the brief seems to
require marking a PR ready, that is a brief defect — stop and surface it, do not
work around the block.
