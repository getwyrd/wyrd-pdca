"""A split must not strand its own children on the run that caused it (#469).

Before this, the drive set froze at the start of the run: `_drive_and_act` computed
`wave_list` once and drove exactly the bundles it was handed, so when a bundle reached
`close-disposition = split` mid-run the parent went terminal, the children materialised by
`pdca split --accept` sat PLANNED and undriven, and the operator restarted the whole thing
by hand with `pdca flow <child-ids>`.

Every drive here goes **through `cli._flow`** — never a hand-picked `flow.*` call — because
that is the surface the operator (and their automation) actually uses, and the surface
where four of #449's five iterations found their parity breaks. Both CLI shapes are the
same machinery since #468 (`cli.py:604-622`), so a run started either way exercises the one
drive path this feature lives on.

Everything is the ordinary offline driver suite: all six leaves stubbed (the fixture
mirrors `tests/test_flow_slice.py:32-55`), gates empty, no tracker / network / `gh` /
container. The split itself is not simulated — the tests call the PRODUCTION `split.accept`
(`split.py:525`), so the parent's close marker, its `split-lineage.json` children record
and the child bundles are byte-for-byte what `pdca split --accept` leaves on disk.

Modules are imported, never new symbols (`from pdca_harness import cli, flow, …`): a
`from pdca_harness.flow import <new helper>` would raise ImportError on the C4 red leg,
which `engine/scripts/run-verify.sh` classifies PDCA-UNVERIFIABLE rather than red.
