"""The interactive leaves' exit contract is judged when the driver reaps the session,
never at a turn end (issue #534; stdlib unittest, offline, no Claude/TTY).

#331 registered `handoff_guard.py` as a Claude Code **Stop** hook. Stop fires every time
the main agent finishes a turn, not when the session ends, and exit 2 sends the hook's
stderr back to the MODEL instead of handing the turn to the human. An interactive leaf
that asked the human a question therefore never reached the human: the model was told
to write the missing artifact (for sign-off, the human's own decision) and was blocked
again on every turn.

Covers, against the #534 success criterion:
  (a) no turn end is intercepted: the template registers no Stop hook, and the hook run
      the way the old registration ran it (no arguments, a Stop envelope on stdin, a
      registered session whose contract is UNDISCHARGED) exits 0 and prints nothing, so
      an instance whose settings.json still carries the old registration (a `copier
      update` merge that kept it) cannot deadlock either;
  (b) the contract is reported when the driver reaps the leaf (`handoff.session`): what
      `stop_problems()` finds goes to stderr naming the role and each bundle, and a
      discharged contract prints nothing; a Plan with no registered bundle set has
      every brief it created or changed re-read (issue #549);
  (c) report only: nothing under the project root changes, and nothing raises out of
      the context manager — not a check that fails, not a scratch file the session
      broke; the leaf's own exception passes through untouched;
  (d) the report hides nothing: an abandon reason is printed first and the problem list
      still follows; a blank `abandoned` is no reason; a bundle whose check raises is
      named and every other bundle is still reported; a `[[doctor.checks]]` table that
      cannot be read is ONE line at every planner reap (bundles registered or not,
      briefs or not) naming the file, the error and the unchecked dependency clause,
      while the rest of every brief is still checked and reported;
  (e) nothing the session wrote is printed raw: every line the reap prints is printable
      (checked on every reap below), so a terminal escape in an abandon reason or a
      brief cannot hide the lines after it;
  (g) the text the MODEL reads — the `/handoff` command body, the leaf prompts, the
      hook's own replies — no longer says a hook enforces the contract when a turn or
      the session ends;
  (h) `/handoff <id>` (`--check`) and `--abandon` keep working.
(f), a quiet suite, is a property of the whole driver suite: every reap here is
captured, and so must be any test elsewhere that reaps an undischarged session.

RED on a tree without the fix: settings.json registers the Stop hook and the hook's
no-argument mode returns 2 for an undischarged contract (a); `session()` prints only an
abandon reason, raw, when it exits, and `stop_problems()` returns nothing once
`abandoned` is set (b–e); the prompts and the command body name the Stop hook (g).
