"""A bundle-scoped gate is told exactly one base — $PDCA_BASE / $PDCA_VERIFY_BASE /
$PDCA_BRIEF_BASE (#273, #387).

Under the wave model, a dependent bundle's Do worktree is cut off the run-scoped integration
branch (prior waves' folded patches). A per-fix verifier that resets to a base must reset to
THAT branch, not the brief's origin base — else the dependent false-fails "patch does not
apply" or measures red→green against a tree lacking its prereq. The driver exports the folded
base as `PDCA_VERIFY_BASE=origin/<integration-branch>` to bundle-scoped gate commands, read
from the per-bundle `stack-base` marker the wave driver stamped before Check. A wave-0 bundle
has no marker, so the var is absent and behaviour is unchanged.

The ordinary wave-0 bundle then gets the LAST rung of the published ladder (#387):
`PDCA_BRIEF_BASE=<base_remote>/<brief base branch>`, resolved by the driver with the same
anchored parser publish uses — so a gate script never parses `brief.md` itself and the two
implementations of that parse (#235, #262) cannot disagree.

Real gate commands, no model/network. Run from the project root:
    PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests
