"""Auto-iterate while Check still finds implementation work (issues #264, #409; stdlib
unittest).

The driver may rebuild a bundle unattended when its SUMMARY §6 carries at least one
implementation defect — a `gate` cell of the 5/5/1 (C2/C4/T1..T4), or an advisory finding the
leaf tagged `[impl]`. Since #409 a HUMAN finding beside it (a `judgment` cell C5/T5/V, an
`input` cell C1/C3, a gate that could not run, an external dependency, an unmarked advisory
bullet, a row it cannot classify) no longer vetoes that rebuild: it is DEFERRED to
`deferred-findings.json` and returns to §6 at handover, where C6 still makes the human clear
it. A §6 with no implementation work still halts at once. Exactly two things stop the loop
while implementation work remains: the size backstop's item and `max_auto_iters`. A row
saying a review or a gate gave no verdict is not deferred: the next Check runs them again, so
a failure that has recovered never needs clearing by hand at handover.

Load-bearing negatives, each its own test: it must never auto-accept, never tick a §6 box,
never lose a HUMAN finding it iterated past, never retire one the human did not tick, and
never run past either stop. Offline: stub leaves, real gate commands, no Claude.

New symbols are reached as module attributes (`autoiterate.retire_cleared`), never imported
at module top: with the production change reverted, an import error would read as "the
module never loaded", not as the red leg.
