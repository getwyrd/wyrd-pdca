"""Auto-iterate on implementation-only Check findings (issue #264, stdlib unittest).

The driver may rebuild a bundle unattended when EVERY open SUMMARY §6 item is an
implementation defect — a `gate` cell of the 5/5/1 (C2/C4/T1..T4), or an advisory finding
the leaf tagged `[impl]`. Anything architectural (a `judgment` cell C5/T5/V, an `input` cell
C1/C3), a gate that could not run, an external dependency, an unmarked advisory bullet, or a
row it cannot classify still halts for the human.

Load-bearing negatives, each its own test: it must never auto-accept, never tick a §6 box,
never iterate past a judgment finding, and never run past its budget. Offline: stub leaves,
real gate commands, no Claude.
