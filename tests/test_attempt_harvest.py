"""No dead attempt's artifact is harvested as a live attempt's work (issue #541).

A retried reviewer / advisory leaf runs every attempt in the SAME sandbox, and all three
harvest sites used to end with the same hand-copied `if produced.exists(): copy2(...)`.
That test knows nothing about WHICH attempt wrote the file — so a truncated verdict an
attempt left behind before it died transiently was copied out as the output of the attempt
that exited 0 afterwards, and the bundle reached sign-off carrying a dead attempt's text as
its review. "No evidence" must never be filed as a verdict.

The three sites now share ONE owner (`leaves._LeafHarvest`), which is told of each death as
it happens: the dying attempt's file comes OFF the path and into the bundle's `*.error.log`
(preserved, not deleted — and bounded, since that log is tracked), so what is harvested
afterwards is the live attempt's own work or nothing at all. When the file cannot be
withdrawn, the path is un-owned: the leaf still gets every attempt the shipped stop rule
gives it, and the harvest refuses rather than filing a file it cannot attribute.

The refusal is settled by the residue's filesystem IDENTITY, not by its bytes, which is what
keeps it from destroying a LIVE verdict: an attempt that writes over a residue this harness
could not unlink — in place, byte-identically, or atomically over one it could not even read
— has produced its own verdict, and that file is filed. Only "the same file, unchanged" is
refused.

Same root cause, second face: an artifact was CLASSIFIED — placeholder or real verdict? —
with no notion of who produced it either, by matching a `pdca:leaf-status` marker anywhere in
its text. So a real report that merely QUOTES a marker (every advisory review of this harness
does) was read as a placeholder, and all three readers of that answer acted on it: §6
relabelled its findings and forced them HUMAN, stripping the `[impl]` routing (#264); the
size signal counted the round ambiguous; the plan-advisory findings were discarded. Evidence
that existed was turned back into "no evidence" — the same invariant, aimed the other way.

What settles it now is a positive completion trailer the LEAF writes as the artifact's last
non-blank line: an artifact its author closed is real whatever it quotes, and a dying
attempt's half-written report is very unlikely to have closed itself — it would need to be cut
off exactly on a line that quotes the trailer. Absence classifies nothing — a leaf that never
emits it, and every artifact in the back catalogue, behaves exactly as before.

The harvest legs drive the REAL site entry points with a stub "leaf" that is a Python
interpreter (the `template/tests/test_leaf_resilience.py` harness), so the production spawn,
the retry loop, the sandbox and the harvest all run; the classification legs drive the three
production readers directly. Offline, no model, no network. Run from `template/`:

# A claude-family leaf so the stream path engages (the only path that yields the "did a

# running this inline script; `_invoke` appends --output-format/--verbose (ignored) and
# feeds the prompt on stdin. The script counts its own invocations into $PDCA_TEST_CNT so a
# test can assert the retry count, and behaves per attempt:
#   * the first attempt writes $PDCA_TEST_DEAD to the artifact path — a truncated verdict —
#     optionally padded with $PDCA_TEST_BULK × $PDCA_TEST_REPEAT and closed by
#     $PDCA_TEST_END, so a leg can build a residue far too large to quote whole; then,
#     with $PDCA_TEST_UNREADABLE, makes that file unreadable, and/or with $PDCA_TEST_LOCK
#     makes its own cwd read-only so the harness cannot UNLINK what it left (a residue that
#     survives its author — note the file itself stays writable, which is the whole point of
#     the overwrite legs below);
#   * the first $PDCA_TEST_DEATHS attempts then die at invocation (stderr only, no stdout →
#     no session started → the transient-infra signal);

#     careful leaf writes over a file it cannot open for reading — and then prints its
