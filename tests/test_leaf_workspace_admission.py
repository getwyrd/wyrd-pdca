"""Interactive-leaf workspace admission (issue #494, stdlib unittest, no deps).

Every leaf the driver spawns runs with cwd ``cfg.root`` (a claude-family CLI walks up
from cwd to find ``.claude/agents`` + its hooks — ``leaves._do_build_command``), so
anything it is told to read outside that root has to be ADMITTED to its workspace by the
driver, via the family's grounding flag (``--add-dir`` for claude/codex,
``--include-directories`` for gemini — families.py:93/:112/:123). The headless half
already does that: the builder's worktree and bundle dir (``_do_build_command``), the
reviewer's resolved target (``_run_review_sandboxed``), both advisories. The six
INTERACTIVE spawns — ``do_plan``, ``do_plan_batch``, ``run_signoff``,
``run_signoff_batch``, ``run_act``, ``run_publish`` —
passed no ``extra_argv`` at all, while their prompts point straight at
the target checkout. So the human was asked to approve the same out-of-workspace read
every session, and could not make the approval stick: the grant would live in the
operator's untracked ``.claude/settings.local.json``, which a lane worktree never
materializes and ``--setting-sources project`` (families.py:100-102) drops by design.
A seventh interactive spawn — the plan-advisory revision pass inside
``run_plan_advisory_batch``, entered from ``do_plan``/``do_plan_batch`` when
``[[leaves.plan_advisory]]`` findings trigger it — had the same defect and is covered
below by the bundle-scoped rule (i), not Plan's known-target fallback (ii): the revision
already knows the bundles it is about (issue #550).

This module asserts the whole contract over the argv the driver produces — which is the
whole of what the harness controls:

* (i)   each of the six admits the primary checkout the bundles of THAT session resolve
        to, deduped, existing-directories only;
* (ii)  with nothing to resolve, and ONLY for Plan (the beat that authors the first
        brief), it is the instance's known target set — ``[publisher.checkouts]`` ∪ what
        its existing briefs resolve to. A sign-off / Act / publish session already has a
        bundle to be about and NEVER widens to that set, even when its own bundle names
        a repo this host has no checkout of;
* (iii) never a lane worktree, even with one on disk that ``worktree.path()`` returns;
* (iv)  nothing wider — an existing sibling checkout named by neither the config nor any
        brief is never admitted, nor is the parent directory holding them;
* (v)   a family with no grounding mechanism (``generic``) is spawned byte-identically;
* (vi)  no other spawn property moves — cwd stays ``cfg.root``, the handoff env survives.
