"""The Remote Control seam is documented on the interactive leaves (issue #337).

The four `interactive = true` leaves hand the terminal to a REPL and block there, so a
rendered instance inherits a constraint nothing tells it about: the human must be at the
terminal the flow runs in, for the whole batch. Claude Code's `--remote-control` removes
it, and enabling it in one's OWN shell does not reach the leaves — each is a separate
subprocess whose argv comes from `pdca.toml`. That gap between "the feature exists" and
"it reaches the leaves" is exactly what makes it worth documenting.

No engine change: the value is entirely in the template making the seam visible.
