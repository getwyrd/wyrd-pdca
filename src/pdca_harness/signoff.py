    The single place that answers "is this artifact signable?". :func:`record` raises on it,

    lenient, so on a summary with no §6 heading it scans the whole document and can return
    "blocked" for an accept — stopping before the repair path and stranding the bundle
    exactly as an unrepaired malformed summary does (#330 review). Whether the artifact can
    be written to is a property of the artifact, not of the decision, so it is settled first.

    A §9 that exists but carries no ``- Outcome:`` line counts as unrecordable: ``set_field``
    would substitute nothing and return success, so ``pdca signoff --accept`` exited 0 while
    leaving the bundle at AWAITING_SIGNOFF — a silent no-op reported as a sign-off.

    **A missing §6 counts too, and that is the subtle one.** :func:`open_needs_human` falls
    back to scanning the whole document, which is safe only while the checkboxes survive
    SOMEWHERE — deleting the heading finds more items, deleting the *section* deletes its
    items with it. Then C6 sees an empty list and reads "the human cleared everything" from
    an artifact that merely lost the evidence, so an accept records and publish is released
    (#330 review). Section deletion is explicitly in the leaf-damage threat model
    (``flow._isolate``), so zero surviving checkboxes cannot be treated as proof C6 is clear.
