"""The interactive leaves' checked exit contract (issue #331).

Today the driver's entire completion signal for an interactive leaf is process exit —
``leaves._invoke`` runs ``subprocess.run(argv + [seed], ...)`` with no ``check=`` and
captures nothing — so "the human pressed Ctrl-D" and "the leaf discharged its contract"
are the same event, and a malformed/absent artifact is discovered later, far from the
cause. This module gives each interactive leaf a *checked* boundary:

* :func:`run_check` — the ``/handoff <issue_id>`` verdict: verify the CURRENT leaf's
  contract for ONE named id and report PASS/FAIL. Ids are REQUIRED — there is no scan
  mode (prototype finding, getwyrd/wyrd-pdca#166: a scan judges old bundles against a
  contract that postdates them; a named id only ever judges what this session worked).
* :func:`stop_problems` — the session-end verdict, judged when the driver REAPS the
  leaf's process (:func:`session`) and reported to the human on stderr
  (:func:`report_at_reap`). It re-reads the artifacts of every bundle the driver
  registered. A planner session the driver registered none for (the CSV/default batch
  Plan, which picks its issues mid-session) has every brief it created or changed since
  spawn re-read instead (issue #549). Where that leaves nothing to re-read (Act, or a
  batch Plan that changed no brief) it requires a passing ``/handoff``. The report
  never blocks, never reopens the session and never changes bundle state; a deliberate
  abandon (:func:`record_abandon`) is printed first and hides nothing. It is not a
  turn-end check (issue #534): #331 ran it as a Claude Code ``Stop`` hook, but Stop
  fires every time the agent finishes a TURN, and a Stop hook's exit 2 sends its text
  back to the model instead of handing the turn to the human, so a leaf that asked the
  human a question could never reach them.
* :func:`session` — the driver-side registration: env for the spawned leaf naming its
  role and a session-state scratch file (the act-log baseline where authorship must be
  distinguished, the spawn-time brief fingerprints of a planner session with no
  registered bundle set, the abandon channel, the record of passed ``/handoff`` runs).
  The scratch file lives OUTSIDE the bundle: the gate's verdict is exit status +
  report, never a bundle artifact (prototype finding — no ``handoff.json``).

Which contract applies is derived from the RENDER — the ``interactive = true`` leaves
and their ``agent`` names in ``pdca.toml`` (:func:`contracts`) — not from a hardcoded
leaf list. Per-field brief checks go through :func:`brief.whole_field`, because the
measured corpus (85 bundles) writes multi-line values the line-based
``brief.parse_fields`` reads as empty; and only the fields every template mandates AND
the corpus actually satisfies are required (``Test file`` is legitimately empty in 7
bundles, ``Falsifiability`` absent in 52/85 — neither is required here).

    Yields the env to merge into the spawn: the role and a session-state scratch file
    (created in ``cfg.root`` with the gitignored :data:`STATE_PREFIX`, removed on exit).
    Captures the session-start act-log baseline for the act role. For a planner session
    with NO registered bundle set (the CSV/default batch Plan, issue #549), it records a
    fingerprint of every existing ``issue_*/brief.md`` (:func:`_brief_fingerprints`),
    which the reap diffs to find the briefs the session created or changed. Every brief
    is fingerprinted, placeholder or not. That differs from ``leaves._brief_snapshot``,
    which leaves placeholders out of its before picture: here a brief the session did
    not touch is never re-read, whatever it holds. A brief that cannot be read is
    fingerprinted by its read error, so it does not fail the setup. A planner session
    with registered bundles takes no snapshot. Yields ``{}`` — no contract — when the
    render does not mark the leaf interactive (criterion f), and on ANY setup failure
    (a checked exit contract must never break the leaf it checks).

    On exit, which is the driver reaping the leaf's process, the contract is judged and
    the verdict reported to the human (:func:`report_at_reap`, issue #534).

    ``outcome`` (INSTANCE DELTA, eduralph/pdca-harness#579), when a dict is
    passed, receives ``{"discharged": bool}`` at reap — for the caller whose OWN side
    effect must not fire on an undischarged session (#233 review, P1). Most callers need
    nothing: their side effect is the artifact itself, so a missing one already stops the
    state machine. Act is the exception — ``mark_reviewed`` advances a global frontier
    that no artifact gates. It is ``True`` on every no-contract path (non-interactive
    leaf, setup failure, a broken check) and on a deliberate abandon: a contract that was
    never established must not withhold a caller's work.

      the session changed no brief, the next rule applies.
    * **No registered bundle set and nothing re-read** (Act, which has no brief to
      re-read; a batch Plan that changed no brief): the session must have named its
