"""The model leaves — the only points where a model is invoked (docs 03 §leaves).

The rest of the pipeline is deterministic code; models fill *artifacts*, never
decide control flow. The cycle has exactly **four beats** (Plan · Do · Check · Act);
the leaves are model touchpoints *within* those beats, not beats of their own — in
particular review, sign-off and publish are all **steps of the Check beat**. The six
leaves:

* **planner** (Plan, interactive) — the human feeds documents (e.g. a tracker CSV)
  and Claude writes ``brief.md``;
* **builder** (Do, headless) — reads ``brief.md``, writes ``patch.diff`` + the
  named test + ``build-notes.md``;
* **reviewer** (Check — review step, headless) — advisory, decorrelated, writes
  ``check-review.md``;
* **signoff** (Check — sign-off step, interactive) — Claude reviews the result
  *with* the human and records the decision token;
* **publisher** (Check — publish step, interactive) — on an accepted bundle, writes
  the contribution artifacts (the ``publish`` module does the git/draft-PR);
* **act** (Act, interactive) — reviews frozen cycles and proposes process deltas.

Two invariants live here and matter more than any prompt:

1. **Independence is a missing input.** The reviewer never sees ``build-notes.md``.
   In ``stub`` mode it simply isn't passed; in ``command`` mode the reviewer runs
   in a temp sandbox containing *only* the reviewer inputs, so the file is
   physically absent (a prompt instruction would not be enough).
2. **The builder cannot mark a PR ready.** Enforced by the ``builder`` subagent's
   tool scope + the ``builder_guard.py`` PreToolUse hook; the stub never does it.

``mode == "stub"`` writes offline placeholders (no Claude/TTY). ``mode ==
"command"`` runs the configured ``argv`` with the leaf's prompt appended, as a
subprocess in the working dir; ``interactive`` leaves inherit the terminal.

    Interactive leaves get the prompt as a *seed positional* (``claude "<prompt>"``)

    the session) is not fatal. A seed over the OS single-arg limit is spilled to a
    scratch file and replaced with a pointer (see :func:`_seed_positional`). Headless
    leaves get the prompt on **stdin**, not as
    a trailing positional — a variadic option such as ``--allowedTools`` would
    otherwise swallow the prompt arg (claude then errors "Input must be provided…").

    ``label`` / ``status`` decorate the headless heartbeat (which leaf, and a live
    snapshot of its work — see :func:`progress.bundle_activity`). ``stream_json``
    (Tier 3) asks for the live tool-use stream when the leaf's family profile has
    one (``profile.stream_argv``, e.g. claude's ``--output-format stream-json``);
    families without a stream format ignore it. ``cfg`` enables the profile-driven
    extras (role injection, model/effort mapping, ``[families.*]`` overrides);
    ``None`` falls back to the built-in profile for the leaf's family.

    Both branches spawn inside the leaf's configured memory bound when there is one
    (``[driver].leaf_memory_max`` / ``[leaves.*].memory_max``, issue #420) — see
    :func:`_memory_cap_prefix`. Unset (the default) or unenforceable on this host ⇒
    the argv spawned here is byte-identical to what it was before that knob existed.

    ``memory_log``, when given AND the bound is actually in force, turns on the
    bound's observability arm for a headless leaf (:class:`_MemoryTelemetry`): scope
    samples land there as JSONL, the heartbeat line grows a ``mem …/… · N procs``
    suffix, and a failing leaf's :class:`LeafError` carries a memory post-mortem in
    its ``output``. Unbounded or interactive spawns ignore it — without a scope
    there is nothing attributable to sample.

    ``on_event`` is handed to :func:`progress.run_with_heartbeat` (issue #526): it sees
    every decoded event of the leaf's stream, a successful run's included — the only
    view a caller gets of what happened inside a run that exited 0. Ignored when the

    A transient-infra death (:attr:`LeafError.transient`) is retried with exponential
    backoff: a non-zero exit before the leaf emitted any work, where no report says why (a
    rate limit, a 5xx or a network blip at invocation), or one whose main session ended on
    the CLI's own report of a cause the vendor marks transient (a lost connection, an
    overload or 5xx, a passing rate-limit rejection) however much work came first — not a
    reviewer that read the diff and couldn't decide. Every other failure is substantive and
    not retried: a leaf that worked and then failed on its own account, one a **signal**
    killed (#510), one whose stream says the account's usage limit is refusing requests (a
    spent subscription window, which refuses every attempt until it resets), or a
    non-LeafError (e.g. command not found). A retry is a fresh re-invoke of the whole leaf,
    not a resume of its session. Each failed attempt's captured stderr
    tail is written to ``error_log`` AS IT HAPPENS (#540), so the bundle carries
    recoverable error text, not just an exit code, from the moment there is any — and a
    run killed inside the retry loop leaves a post-mortem instead of nothing at all. The
    record is settled (:func:`state.settled_record`) only when the attempts are spent;
    until then it carries no settlement marker, so every reader treats it exactly as it
    treats an absent log and the leaf is re-run rather than retired. Returns ``None`` on
    success, else the final exception (a :class:`LeafError` exposes ``.transient``).

    The unfinished state's whole lifetime is inside this function: the loop ends either by
    failing, which settles the records, or by succeeding, which discards them — so no
    caller ever has to know about it.

    ``harvest`` (#541) is the :class:`_LeafHarvest` that owns the artifact path the leaf
    writes to. Every attempt runs in the SAME workdir, so a file a dying attempt left there
    is still sitting at that path when the next attempt starts — and the caller's
    ``if produced.exists()`` could not tell whose work it was. The owner is therefore told
    of each death as it happens (``withdraw``): it takes the dead attempt's file OFF the
    path and returns it quoted, as part of that attempt's record, so nothing is destroyed
    and nothing can be re-attributed. Passing no owner leaves this function byte-identical
    to #540 — a caller with no artifact of its own (a direct test drive) has nothing to own.

    Every attempt also runs under memory telemetry when its spawn is memory-capped:
    the ``*.memory.jsonl`` twin of ``error_log`` (`_memory_log_for`), cleared here
    under the same staleness rule, each attempt's samples separated by its ``spawn``

    All three harvest sites — the Check reviewer, a Check advisory leaf, a plan advisory
    leaf — used to end with the same hand-copied test: ``if produced.exists(): copy2(...)``,
    else a placeholder. That test knows nothing about WHICH attempt wrote the file, and every
    attempt runs in the same sandbox — so a truncated verdict left behind by an attempt that
    then died transiently was copied out as the output of the attempt that exited 0
    afterwards. The engine's rule is the opposite one: no evidence must never be
    filed as a verdict (``engine/README.md`` §The two gate shapes that matter — "a gate
    never turns 'no evidence' into a verdict"). Copying it in three places is what let
    a fix land at two sites and leave the third wrong, so the mechanism lives here once and
    the sites hold only what genuinely differs — the paths and their own §6 prose.

    Two moments, both driven by :func:`_invoke_leaf_resilient`:

    * :meth:`withdraw`, as each attempt dies — the file that attempt left is taken OFF the
      path and returned quoted, so it lands in the bundle's ``*.error.log`` as that
      attempt's account instead of being silently deleted (a real verdict must not be
      destroyed while the operator is told none was produced) and can never be read as a
      later attempt's work. If it cannot be withdrawn, the path is UN-OWNED from then on;
      that state is carried forward rather than ending the run — the leaf keeps every
      attempt the shipped stop rule gives it, and the refusal is paid at the harvest.
    * :meth:`run`, around the whole loop — on a failure the site's placeholder, on success
      the harvest itself: the live attempt's own file, or nothing at all. An un-owned path
      is settled by IDENTITY there (:meth:`_live_attempt_took_the_path`), not refused on
      sight: a residue that could not be unlinked can still have been overwritten by the
      attempt that exited 0, and that file is its verdict.

    Every residue it could not remove is remembered by :func:`_residue_identity`, which is
    what makes both of those exact rather than heuristic: the same file is recognised on a
    later attempt's death (quoted once, not once per attempt) and at the harvest (refused),
    while a file that has been written since is recognised as the live attempt's work
    whether or not its bytes differ.

#
# Every directory the harness INSTRUCTS a leaf to read must be admitted to that leaf's
# workspace BY THE HARNESS, through the family's grounding flag. The headless half
# already does it — ``_do_build_command`` for the builder's worktree and bundle dir,
# ``_run_review_sandboxed`` for the reviewer's resolved target, both advisories — but the
# six interactive spawns (Plan single/batch, sign-off single/batch, Act, publish) passed no
# ``extra_argv`` at all, while their prompts point straight at the target checkout
# (``_plan_prompt``'s citation line, planner.md.jinja, publisher.md.jinja). Their cwd is
# ``cfg.root``, so that checkout sat OUTSIDE the workspace: the human was asked to
# approve the same out-of-workspace read every session, and could not make the approval
# stick — a hand-granted rule lives in the operator's untracked
# ``.claude/settings.local.json``, which a lane worktree never materializes and
# ``--setting-sources project`` (families.py:100-102) drops by design. The spawn's argv
# is the durable channel, and the one the headless half already uses.
#
# The set is DERIVED, never guessed, and both edges of the confinement doctrine bind:
# under-admission asks the human for a decision that cannot take effect, on the one band
# that cannot be retried unattended; over-admission hands a leaf reach the configuration
# never granted (:func:`_plan_fallback_target` refuses exactly that). So there are TWO
# grants, and which one a call site may use is a property of its ROLE:
#
#   :func:`_bundle_grant` — sign-off (single/batch), Act, publish. Strictly the
#       checkouts the bundles THIS session is about resolve to. A session that HAS a
#       bundle whose checkout does not resolve admits nothing; it must never widen to
#       the instance's other, unrelated targets — that is over-admission for a session
#       that already knows what it is about.
#   :func:`_plan_grant`   — Plan (single/batch) ONLY. The same resolution, falling back
#       to the instance's KNOWN targets when nothing resolves — which pre-brief is the
#       normal case, and is the whole of the question "what may the planner read before
#       a brief exists to name a repo".

# line, and an artifact that ends with it is read as a real verdict whatever its body quotes.
# Its absence changes nothing. An artifact without it (a leaf that ignores this, or a
# third-party leaf that never saw this prompt) is classified exactly as it was before the
# trailer existed, and whether an artifact is filed at all never depends on it: keeping a dead
# attempt's leftover file out of the bundle is `_LeafHarvest`'s ownership check, which does
# not read the trailer. So the instruction says only what the trailer does. It must not
# threaten a cost for leaving it off — there is none, and a leaf told that a report without
# the trailer is not read as its verdict could leave it off on purpose, to hold a report back.
# Instructed rather than stamped by the harness after the fact, deliberately: only the writer
# can say it finished, and a stamp applied to whatever is at the path would re-assert exactly
# the assumption #541 removed.
#
# Appended LAST, as its own paragraph, at the point each prompt is composed — after the
# project rubric where the leaf gets one — so it is the final thing the leaf reads. An
# instruction that says "nothing may follow it" must not itself be followed by more prompt.

    * the confinement flag (:func:`_settings_scope_argv`) is meaningless AND DANGEROUS
      without the seeded settings file on disk — it drops the operator's ambient sandbox in
      favour of a project scope that does not exist, leaving the leaf wholly unconfined

      a failed write says nothing about it. Gating it on ``seeded`` would silently kill a
      codex leaf's Docker access because of a claude-shaped failure it has no stake in.

    Two grants, two shapes, because the vendors' sandboxes differ and neither is strictly
    tighter (#291) — so they are separate opt-ins, each named for what it actually does:

    * ``[leaves.sandbox] unsandboxed_commands`` (claude) — a NAMED command leaves the sandbox
      entirely; every other command stays confined. Realized by the seeded ``excludedCommands``
      + the confinement flags from :func:`_settings_scope_argv`.
    * ``[leaves.sandbox] network_access`` (codex) — ``--sandbox workspace-write`` has no
      per-command escape, and its docker-socket denial is **seccomp, not filesystem** (a relayed
      socket in a granted writable dir is still refused), so only opening the network layer
      works. That frees the socket/network layer for EVERY command in the leaf, while the
      filesystem stays confined for every command. It cannot be scoped to one command, which is
      exactly why it does not ride on ``unsandboxed_commands`` — that key promises "only these
      commands leave the sandbox", and this would not keep the promise.

    human-run confirmer — the process gets burdensome exactly where it should be mechanical
    (#276). The fix is NOT a socket-wide grant (``allowAllUnixSockets`` would hand *every*
    Bash line the leaf writes access to *every* unix socket — and a root-owned docker daemon
    is root-adjacent). It is a **named-command exemption**: ``[leaves.sandbox]
    unsandboxed_commands`` in pdca.toml lists the conformance commands, and only those run
    outside the sandbox. Everything else the leaf does stays confined — which holds only
    because the exemption ships with ``allowUnsandboxedCommands: false`` beside it; the list
    is a *ceiling*, not a floor (see below).

    That list is **harness-owned on purpose**. This function never copies the project's own
    ``sandbox.excludedCommands`` — that is the operator's *gate* workaround, and inheriting it
    would let the leaf run whatever the operator exempted for CI (PR #268). A leaf's exemption
    is declared once, deliberately, in pdca.toml.

    **Seeded through an ALLOW-LIST of individual keys** (:data:`_SEEDED_NETWORK_KEYS`), never
    by copying the ``sandbox`` block, and never ``permissions``. Each wider copy would hand
    the leaf a capability its ``tools:`` frontmatter does not grant: ``permissions.allow``
    carries ``Edit``/``Write``, and ``sandbox.excludedCommands`` — which docs 05 recommends to
    a project as the workaround for its *gates* — makes the named command bypass the sandbox
    **entirely**, so a reviewer could run the test runner unconfined (PR #268 review). Widening
    the seed means adding a key here, deliberately — not loosening the copy.

    Each key is **value-filtered**, so a present-but-empty grant seeds nothing: that is how a
    grant stays OFF by default (the shipped ``allowedDomains: []`` documents the knob without
    enabling it). Nothing granted at all ⇒ no file written, so an instance that configures no
    sandbox is unaffected.

    The two sources are **independent**. The network grants are the project's, read from its
    ``.claude/settings.json`` best-effort; the command exemptions are the harness's, read from
    ``pdca.toml``. An absent or unparseable settings file costs the network grant and nothing
    else — it must never suppress a pdca.toml exemption (PR #288 review). Best-effort
    throughout, like the agent seeding: any read/parse/write error degrades to a no-op, never
    an aborted Check.

    Scope: this covers the reviewer / advisory **leaves**. Gate commands are plain
    subprocesses of ``pdca`` and inherit the operator's ambient sandbox instead (docs 05).
    The **codex** family sandbox (``codex exec --sandbox workspace-write``) is not configured by
    this file at all — it reads none of it. Its grants ride on ``argv`` instead: ``[leaves.sandbox]
    network_access`` opens its socket/network layer, which is the only thing that reaches the
    docker socket *or* api.github.com there (#291, :func:`_sandbox_argv`).

    # must be closed or "only these commands run outside the sandbox" — the promise made in
    # this docstring, in docs 05 and in pdca.toml — is not true (PR #288 review):
    #
    # 1. `allowUnsandboxedCommands` defaults to TRUE (settings schema, v2.1.207:
    #    `sandbox?.allowUnsandboxedCommands ?? true`), and while true the model may retry ANY
    #    sandbox-denied command with the `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` parameter and have it run
    #    unconfined. False makes that parameter "completely ignored" (the schema's own words).
    #    It is a SCALAR, so the seeded project scope genuinely overrides the operator's.
    # 2. Array-valued settings CONCATENATE across scopes (user → project → local → managed):
    #    the CLI folds each scope through a merge customizer that unions any two arrays, and
    #    that union is MONOTONIC — no scope, not even managed policy, can remove what a lower
    #    one added. So the operator's own `~/.claude/settings.json` `excludedCommands` (their
    #    INTERACTIVE exemptions — a broad `docker *`) merges straight into the leaf, and a
    #    seeded list can only ever be a FLOOR. The one way to bound it is to not load the lower
    #    scope at all: the family's `settings_scope_argv` (claude: `--setting-sources
    #    project`), applied by the callers. A family without that flag cannot be bounded, so the
    #    exemption is REFUSED rather than granted unbounded — fail closed, and say why.
    #
    # …and a THIRD hole, which swallows the other two whole (#289). When `sandbox.enabled` is
    # true but the sandbox's own dependencies are missing, Claude Code does NOT fail — it
    # DISABLES the sandbox, warns, and runs every command unconfined ("Sandbox disabled:
    # …dependencies are missing: socat not installed · Commands will run WITHOUT sandboxing").
    # A bounded exemption on top of no sandbox at all is not bounded; it is nothing. So seed
    # `failIfUnavailable` — "Exit with an error at startup if sandbox.enabled is true but the
    # sandbox cannot start" (its schema) — and let the leaf REFUSE rather than run unconfined
    # under a boundary this file, docs 05 and pdca.toml all claim it has. It fails loudly, and
    # the tail lands in the bundle's `*.error.log` (#280/#286) instead of scrollback. `pdca

    very sandbox cannot start and Bash is dead — and ``acceptEdits`` approves a write
    anywhere in the leaf's working directories, the ``--add-dir`` target included

    name the failure class and point at the captured error log when present.

    Leads with a machine-readable leaf-status marker (#278). Without it, an empty advisory
    artifact is ambiguous — "the adversary ran and found nothing" reads exactly like "the
    adversary never ran", so an infra failure (no Docker, missing binary) presents as a clean
    adversarial pass and the operator has to hand-annotate "infra, not substance". `assemble`
    reads the marker and labels the §6 row accordingly.

    Every infra shape (transient, startup, sandbox) carries an infra marker — no review came
    back either way — but their prose differs, because the operator's next action
    does: a transient blip is safe to re-run as-is; a leaf that never started will fail the
    same way until its command is fixed; a leaf whose seeded sandbox could not start (#526)
    will fail the same way until the HOST can start it.

    The un-owned shape (#541) is the one that gets prose WITHOUT a marker of its own. Its leaf
    RAN and exited 0, so "leaf did not run" would be false of it; it takes the default
    `human-empty` instead, which is true of it: no usable verdict reached the bundle. What a
    token cannot carry (that a dead attempt's file could not be taken off the artifact path,
    and that the remedy is to clear whatever blocked the withdrawal) is spelled out in the
    prose below, where the human reads it.

    The marker only ever says WHY an artifact is a placeholder. Whether it IS one is settled
    by the completion trailer the leaf writes as its artifact's last line
    (:func:`assemble.leaf_status`), which no placeholder here carries. So the status table
    does not grow to tell real from placeholder, and it stays closed at the four in
