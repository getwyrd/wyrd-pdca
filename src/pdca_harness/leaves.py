"""The model leaves — the only points where a model is invoked (docs 03 §leaves).

The rest of the pipeline is deterministic code; models fill *artifacts*, never
decide control flow. The cycle has exactly **four beats** (Plan · Do · Check · Act);
the leaves are model touchpoints *within* those beats, not beats of their own — in
particular review, sign-off and publish are all **steps of the Check beat**. The six
leaves:

* **planner** (Plan, interactive) — the human feeds documents (e.g. a tracker CSV)
  and Claude writes ``brief.md``;
* **builder** (Do, headless) — reads ``brief.md``, writes ``patch.diff`` + the
  named test + ``build-notes.md``;
* **reviewer** (Check — review step, headless) — advisory, decorrelated, writes
  ``check-review.md``;
* **signoff** (Check — sign-off step, interactive) — Claude reviews the result
  *with* the human and records the decision token;
* **publisher** (Check — publish step, interactive) — on an accepted bundle, writes
  the contribution artifacts (the ``publish`` module does the git/draft-PR);
* **act** (Act, interactive) — reviews frozen cycles and proposes process deltas.

Two invariants live here and matter more than any prompt:

1. **Independence is a missing input.** The reviewer never sees ``build-notes.md``.
   In ``stub`` mode it simply isn't passed; in ``command`` mode the reviewer runs
   in a temp sandbox containing *only* the reviewer inputs, so the file is
   physically absent (a prompt instruction would not be enough).
2. **The builder cannot mark a PR ready.** Enforced by the ``builder`` subagent's
   tool scope + the ``builder_guard.py`` PreToolUse hook; the stub never does it.

``mode == "stub"`` writes offline placeholders (no Claude/TTY). ``mode ==
"command"`` runs the configured ``argv`` with the leaf's prompt appended, as a
subprocess in the working dir; ``interactive`` leaves inherit the terminal.

    ``seeded`` gates ONLY the claude confinement flag, never the codex network grant. The

    * the confinement flag (:func:`_settings_scope_argv`) is meaningless AND DANGEROUS
      without the seeded settings file on disk — it drops the operator's ambient sandbox in
      favour of a project scope that does not exist, leaving the leaf wholly unconfined
      (#290). A failed seed therefore withholds it: fail closed.
    * the codex network grant rides on ``argv``, and codex never reads that file at all, so
      a failed write says nothing about it. Gating it on ``seeded`` would silently kill a
      codex leaf's Docker access because of a claude-shaped failure it has no stake in.

    Two grants, two shapes, because the vendors' sandboxes differ and neither is strictly
    tighter (#291) — so they are separate opt-ins, each named for what it actually does:

    * ``[leaves.sandbox] unsandboxed_commands`` (claude) — a NAMED command leaves the sandbox
      entirely; every other command stays confined. Realized by the seeded ``excludedCommands``
      + the confinement flags from :func:`_settings_scope_argv`.
    * ``[leaves.sandbox] network_access`` (codex) — ``--sandbox workspace-write`` has no
      per-command escape, and its docker-socket denial is **seccomp, not filesystem** (a relayed
      socket in a granted writable dir is still refused), so only opening the network layer
      works. That frees the socket/network layer for EVERY command in the leaf, while the
      filesystem stays confined for every command. It cannot be scoped to one command, which is
      exactly why it does not ride on ``unsandboxed_commands`` — that key promises "only these
      commands leave the sandbox", and this would not keep the promise.

    claude deliberately takes no ``network_argv``: it scopes network by DOMAIN instead

    """Carry the sandbox capabilities a Check needs into the leaf sandbox (#261, #277).

    Claude Code loads **project** settings from ``.claude/settings.json`` relative to the
    subprocess cwd — the same walk-up that finds ``.claude/agents`` (#161). The reviewer /
    advisory leaves run in a temp cwd, so the rendered project's ``.claude/settings.json``
    is invisible to them and its ``sandbox`` policy silently does not apply. Two capabilities
    a Check legitimately needs are denied as a result:

    * ``network.allowLocalBinding`` (#261) — without it the leaf's Bash tool runs under
      Claude Code's bubblewrap+seccomp sandbox where ``TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:0")``
      fails ``Operation not permitted``, so every loopback-socket runtime test panics before
      its assertion and C2/C4/T3 can only ever be *provisional*.
    * ``network.allowedDomains`` (#277) — the reviewer's prior-art check needs the
      closed/rejected-PR corpus (``gh pr list --state closed`` → api.github.com). Blocked, it
      cannot be settled mechanically and is forced NEEDS-HUMAN on *every* bundle.

    Separately, a **Docker-backed conformance gate** (a live etcd/TiKV/FDB cluster via
    ``docker compose``) is denied the docker socket inside the sandbox even on a Docker-capable
    host, so its runtime evidence can never be earned at Check and always defers to a
    human-run confirmer — the process gets burdensome exactly where it should be mechanical
    (#276). The fix is NOT a socket-wide grant (``allowAllUnixSockets`` would hand *every*
    Bash line the leaf writes access to *every* unix socket — and a root-owned docker daemon
    is root-adjacent). It is a **named-command exemption**: ``[leaves.sandbox]
    unsandboxed_commands`` in pdca.toml lists the conformance commands, and only those run
    outside the sandbox. Everything else the leaf does stays confined — which holds only
    because the exemption ships with ``allowUnsandboxedCommands: false`` beside it; the list
    is a *ceiling*, not a floor (see below).

    That list is **harness-owned on purpose**. This function never copies the project's own
    ``sandbox.excludedCommands`` — that is the operator's *gate* workaround, and inheriting it
    would let the leaf run whatever the operator exempted for CI (PR #268). A leaf's exemption
    is declared once, deliberately, in pdca.toml.

    **Seeded through an ALLOW-LIST of individual keys** (:data:`_SEEDED_NETWORK_KEYS`), never
    by copying the ``sandbox`` block, and never ``permissions``. Each wider copy would hand
    the leaf a capability its ``tools:`` frontmatter does not grant: ``permissions.allow``
    carries ``Edit``/``Write``, and ``sandbox.excludedCommands`` — which docs 05 recommends to
    a project as the workaround for its *gates* — makes the named command bypass the sandbox
    **entirely**, so a reviewer could run the test runner unconfined (PR #268 review). Widening
    the seed means adding a key here, deliberately — not loosening the copy.

    Each key is **value-filtered**, so a present-but-empty grant seeds nothing: that is how a
    grant stays OFF by default (the shipped ``allowedDomains: []`` documents the knob without
    enabling it). Nothing granted at all ⇒ no file written, so an instance that configures no
    sandbox is unaffected.

    The two sources are **independent**. The network grants are the project's, read from its
    ``.claude/settings.json`` best-effort; the command exemptions are the harness's, read from
    ``pdca.toml``. An absent or unparseable settings file costs the network grant and nothing
    else — it must never suppress a pdca.toml exemption (PR #288 review). Best-effort
    throughout, like the agent seeding: any read/parse/write error degrades to a no-op, never
    an aborted Check.

    Scope: this covers the reviewer / advisory **leaves**. Gate commands are plain
    subprocesses of ``pdca`` and inherit the operator's ambient sandbox instead (docs 05).
    The **codex** family sandbox (``codex exec --sandbox workspace-write``) is not configured by
    this file at all — it reads none of it. Its grants ride on ``argv`` instead: ``[leaves.sandbox]
    network_access`` opens its socket/network layer, which is the only thing that reaches the
    docker socket *or* api.github.com there (#291, :func:`_sandbox_argv`).

    #    unconfined. False makes that parameter "completely ignored" (the schema's own words).
    #    It is a SCALAR, so the seeded project scope genuinely overrides the operator's.
    # 2. Array-valued settings CONCATENATE across scopes (user → project → local → managed):
    #    the CLI folds each scope through a merge customizer that unions any two arrays, and
    #    that union is MONOTONIC — no scope, not even managed policy, can remove what a lower
    #    one added. So the operator's own `~/.claude/settings.json` `excludedCommands` (their
    #    INTERACTIVE exemptions — a broad `docker *`) merges straight into the leaf, and a
    #    seeded list can only ever be a FLOOR. The one way to bound it is to not load the lower
    #    scope at all: the family's `settings_scope_argv` (claude: `--setting-sources
    #    project`), applied by the callers. A family without that flag cannot be bounded, so the

    # DISABLES the sandbox, warns, and runs every command unconfined ("Sandbox disabled:

    # A bounded exemption on top of no sandbox at all is not bounded; it is nothing. So seed
    # `failIfUnavailable` — "Exit with an error at startup if sandbox.enabled is true but the
    # sandbox cannot start" (its schema) — and let the leaf REFUSE rather than run unconfined
    # under a boundary this file, docs 05 and pdca.toml all claim it has. It fails loudly, and
    # the tail lands in the bundle's `*.error.log` (#280/#286) instead of scrollback. `pdca
