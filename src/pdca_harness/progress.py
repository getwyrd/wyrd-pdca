"""Run a subprocess while ticking an elapsed-time heartbeat (docs 03 §automation).

A headless ``claude -p`` leaf and a Docker-backed gate both produce no output for
minutes; without a heartbeat the flow looks hung and the human kills a job that is
working. This is the single place that pattern lives — shared by the model leaves
(:mod:`pdca_harness.leaves`) and the deterministic gates (:mod:`pdca_harness.gates`).

A ``status`` probe lets the heartbeat show *what* is happening (which artifacts exist
yet, how long since the last write), not just that time passed.

    """Run ``cmd``, printing ``… still working (NmSSs elapsed)`` every ``interval`` s.

    Returns ``(returncode, output, produced)``. ``output`` is the combined
    stdout+stderr when ``capture`` is True (so a gate can keep its evidence line);
    the bounded **stderr tail** when ``stream_json`` or ``tee_stderr`` is set (so a
    failed leaf's real error — usage/rate limit, 5xx, auth — survives in the bundle
    instead of scrolling past on a console nobody is watching), **plus the leaf's own
    terminal error report** when the stream carried one (below); ``""`` otherwise.
    ``produced`` is whether the child emitted a **substantive** stream event — an
    ``assistant`` / ``user`` / ``result`` event, i.e. a session that did real work.
    Claude emits a ``system``/``init`` event (and ``system``/``api_retry`` on a
    retryable API error) *before* doing anything, so those do NOT count: a non-zero
    exit with ``produced is False`` is the transient-infra signal (the child died
    at/near invocation — usage/rate limit, 5xx, auth — before any real output).
    ``input_text``, if given, is written to stdin.

    **The leaf's own account of its death is kept** (issue #506). The CLI *marks* the
    message it synthesises for an API error, and that report arrives as a stream event
    on stdout — which this function already reads, parsed for a tool label and then
    dropped. So the marked report is retained (:func:`_terminal_error`) and appended to
    ``output``, reaching a caller's ``*.error.log`` by the same route the stderr tail
    takes — the one existing precedent being the #420 memory post-mortem, which appends
    to the same string. An 18-minute leaf whose API connection dropped mid-response used
    to file ``(no output captured)``, with the cause legible only in the CLI's session
    transcript under ``~/.claude/projects/`` — a post-mortem artifact that explains
    nothing. Retention only: **nothing here is classified**. ``produced``, and therefore
    every retry decision made from it, is byte-identical to before for every input.

    Three properties this retention is held to:

    * it is **unconditional** — every marked report is kept whatever its cause, including
      one the session then recovered from and one the vendor marked permanent, because a
      harness that is holding the text must never file ``(no output captured)``;
    * a report the CLI forwarded for a **sub-agent** (the Task's ``parent_tool_use_id``,
      ``isSidechain`` in the persisted-transcript spelling) is kept **labelled as such**
      (:data:`_SUBAGENT_NOTE`) — a log that confidently names the wrong death is worse
      than the silence it replaces;
    * where a stream carries several candidate records, the one **nearest the leaf's own
      death** wins and a farther one — a ``result`` wrap-up naming only the effect, a
      sub-agent's report — cannot bury it, in either arrival order
      (:func:`_note_terminal`).

    The append is skipped under ``capture``: there ``output`` is the raw stdout the
    caller asked to keep verbatim (JSONL for a stream family, a gate's evidence line),
    and the report is already in those bytes. Families whose stream this module has no
    observed error shape for (codex) and stream-less families degrade to today's
    behaviour rather than guessing at a vendor's error text.

    ``timeout``, if given, is the wall-clock bound in seconds (issue #368): on expiry
    the child's whole process GROUP is terminated (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after a
    grace) and the returncode slot carries :data:`TIMEOUT_RC` — a distinguishable
    "the oracle did not answer" outcome, never a verdict the child produced. The
    child is started in its own session for this, because a ``shell=True`` gate's
    real work is a *grandchild*: killing only the shell would orphan it, still
    running. ``timeout=None`` (the default) is today's unbounded behaviour,
    unchanged — the heartbeat keeps a hung child looking alive forever, which is
    exactly the 19h-hung-gate failure this bound exists to end.

    On POSIX, every child whose stdio the harness owns (``capture`` /
    ``stream_json`` / ``tee_stderr``) or whose wall-clock is bounded runs in its
    own session, and whatever it leaves running in its process group when it
    exits — by any path: normal return, timeout, Ctrl-C — is swept (SIGTERM,
    short grace, SIGKILL), with one stderr note naming the command (issue #372).
    ``proc.wait`` returning only proves the *direct* child exited; under
    ``shell=True`` (every gate) that child is just the shell, so surviving work
    is the rule, not the edge case — measured: a leaked test process burned
    ~100% of a core for 21 hours, and a straggler still holds ports, locks and
    fixtures when the next cycle's gates run in the same lane worktree. A child
    that exits leaving no survivors sees no sweep and no note. The interactive
    leaves (no capture, no stream, no tee, no bound) are never sessionized: they
    keep the terminal exactly as today.

    ``status``, if given, is called on every tick to append a live snapshot of the
    child's work (e.g. which artifacts exist yet, time since the last write) — so the
    heartbeat shows *what* is happening, not just that time passed (Tier 1+2). It is
    best-effort: any exception it raises is swallowed so a probe can never break the run.

    ``stream_json`` (Tier 3) parses the child's stdout as Claude's
    ``--output-format stream-json`` event stream and surfaces the **tool it is using
    right now** (``▸ Editing patch.diff`` / ``▸ Running run-tests``) on each tick.
    stdout is consumed for parsing (not echoed); stderr is **teed** — still echoed
    live so real errors show, *and* its tail retained for the caller. Mutually
    exclusive with ``capture`` (capture wins if both set).

    ``tee_stderr`` asks for that same stderr tee **without** the stream parse, for a
    family that has no event stream (``generic``, ``gemini``): stdout keeps inheriting
    the terminal (its output stays live, exactly as before), but stderr is piped, echoed,
    and its tail returned — so a stream-less leaf's failure is diagnosable too, and not
    only claude's. Implied by ``stream_json``; ignored under ``capture`` (which already
    keeps everything).

    ``telemetry``, if given, is called with the **child's pid** once right after the
    spawn and again on every tick; a non-empty return is appended to the tick line.
    It is the resource-observation hook (`leaves._MemoryTelemetry` samples the child's
    scope cgroup through it): the pid is the one datum only this function has, and the
    tick is the one moment the harness is already awake while the child works. The same
    best-effort contract as ``status``: any exception it raises is swallowed — an
    observer can never break the run it observes.

    ``on_event``, if given, is called with every decoded ``stream_json`` event, in
    arrival order, from the drain thread (issue #526). The stream is otherwise read here
    and dropped, and on a **clean exit** nothing of it reaches the caller: a leaf that
    exits 0 without doing its job — every command it tried refused by a sandbox that
    could not start — leaves no trace of why. This hook is how a caller keeps what it
    needs from the stream without this function learning the caller's question. Called
    only on the stream path, and only for a line that decodes to a JSON object. The
    same best-effort contract as ``telemetry``: any exception it raises is swallowed.

#
# The incident: an escalated builder ran ~18 minutes, the API connection dropped
# mid-response, the CLI exited 1, and `build.error.log` read "(no output captured)" —
# "a post-mortem artifact that explains nothing" by the harness's own written rule. The
# cause was legible only in the CLI's session transcript under ~/.claude/projects/,
# which no post-mortem reads. The stream carried it the whole time: the drain parsed
# each line for a tool label and dropped it.
#
# The discriminator is NOT the prose. The CLI *marks* the message it synthesises for an
# API error, so a leaf that merely writes about an API error — a builder fixing this very
# defect, quoting the incident line — is never mistaken for one dying of it, whatever its
# wording. Nothing here reads a cause, a kind or a status: this module keeps the text and
# says whose it is, and every retry decision stays exactly where it was.
#
# WHICH field lives on WHICH event is read out of the shipped binary (claude-code
# 2.1.234), not assumed: a rule keyed on a field the CLI never emits is a branch that
# looks like coverage and is not. The main loop's stream emitter is
# `{type:"assistant", …, session_id, parent_tool_use_id: null, uuid, timestamp,
# error: r.error, …r.isApiErrorMessage===!0 && {is_api_error_message:!0}}`; the
# persisted transcript spells the same mark `isApiErrorMessage`. The session's `result`
# wrap-up is built as `{subtype:"success", api_error_status: …, result: <its text>,
# is_error: …}` or, when the turn threw, `{subtype:"error_during_execution",
# errors:[…]}`.
#
# WHOSE death it is, is read out of the same binary: the mark is forwarded to a SUBAGENT's
# messages too (the `agent_progress` branch yields `{type:"assistant",
# parent_tool_use_id: e.parentToolUseID, …, …i.isApiErrorMessage===!0 &&
# {is_api_error_message:!0}}`), and the CLI recovers from those itself. So a sub-agent's
# report is kept LABELLED — never presented as the leaf's own death, and never allowed to
# bury the main session's own report. Both spellings of the scope (the stream's
# `parent_tool_use_id`, the transcript's `isSidechain`) are answered by one predicate,
# `_is_subagent_event`, so they cannot drift apart.
