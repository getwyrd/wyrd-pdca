"""Run a subprocess while ticking an elapsed-time heartbeat (docs 03 §automation).

A headless ``claude -p`` leaf and a Docker-backed gate both produce no output for
minutes; without a heartbeat the flow looks hung and the human kills a job that is
working. This is the single place that pattern lives — shared by the model leaves
(:mod:`pdca_harness.leaves`) and the deterministic gates (:mod:`pdca_harness.gates`).

A ``status`` probe lets the heartbeat show *what* is happening (which artifacts exist
yet, how long since the last write), not just that time passed.

    """Run ``cmd``, printing ``… still working (NmSSs elapsed)`` every ``interval`` s.

    Returns ``(returncode, output, produced)``. ``output`` is the combined
    stdout+stderr when ``capture`` is True (so a gate can keep its evidence line);
    the bounded **stderr tail** when ``stream_json`` or ``tee_stderr`` is set (so a
    failed leaf's real error — usage/rate limit, 5xx, auth — survives in the bundle
    instead of scrolling past on a console nobody is watching); ``""`` otherwise.
    ``produced`` is whether the child emitted a **substantive** stream event — an
    ``assistant`` / ``user`` / ``result`` event, i.e. a session that did real work.
    Claude emits a ``system``/``init`` event (and ``system``/``api_retry`` on a
    retryable API error) *before* doing anything, so those do NOT count: a non-zero
    exit with ``produced is False`` is the transient-infra signal (the child died
    at/near invocation — usage/rate limit, 5xx, auth — before any real output).
    ``input_text``, if given, is written to stdin.

    ``timeout``, if given, is the wall-clock bound in seconds (issue #368): on expiry
    the child's whole process GROUP is terminated (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after a
    grace) and the returncode slot carries :data:`TIMEOUT_RC` — a distinguishable
    "the oracle did not answer" outcome, never a verdict the child produced. The
    child is started in its own session for this, because a ``shell=True`` gate's
    real work is a *grandchild*: killing only the shell would orphan it, still
    running. ``timeout=None`` (the default) is today's unbounded behaviour,
    unchanged — the heartbeat keeps a hung child looking alive forever, which is
    exactly the 19h-hung-gate failure this bound exists to end.

    On POSIX, every child whose stdio the harness owns (``capture`` /
    ``stream_json``) or whose wall-clock is bounded runs in its own session, and
    whatever it leaves running in its process group when it exits — by any path:
    normal return, timeout, Ctrl-C — is swept (SIGTERM, short grace, SIGKILL),
    with one stderr note naming the command (issue #372). ``proc.wait`` returning
    only proves the *direct* child exited; under ``shell=True`` (every gate) that
    child is just the shell, so surviving work is the rule, not the edge case —
    measured: a leaked test process burned ~100% of a core for 21 hours, and a
    straggler still holds ports, locks and fixtures when the next cycle's gates
    run in the same lane worktree. A child that exits leaving no survivors sees
    no sweep and no note. The interactive leaves (no capture, no stream, no
    bound) are never sessionized: they keep the terminal exactly as today.

    ``status``, if given, is called on every tick to append a live snapshot of the
    child's work (e.g. which artifacts exist yet, time since the last write) — so the
    heartbeat shows *what* is happening, not just that time passed (Tier 1+2). It is
    best-effort: any exception it raises is swallowed so a probe can never break the run.

    ``stream_json`` (Tier 3) parses the child's stdout as Claude's
    ``--output-format stream-json`` event stream and surfaces the **tool it is using
    right now** (``▸ Editing patch.diff`` / ``▸ Running run-tests``) on each tick.
    stdout is consumed for parsing (not echoed); stderr is **teed** — still echoed
    live so real errors show, *and* its tail retained for the caller. Mutually
    exclusive with ``capture`` (capture wins if both set).

    ``tee_stderr`` asks for that same stderr tee **without** the stream parse, for a
    family that has no event stream (``generic``, ``gemini``): stdout keeps inheriting
    the terminal (its output stays live, exactly as before), but stderr is piped, echoed,
    and its tail returned — so a stream-less leaf's failure is diagnosable too, and not
    only claude's. Implied by ``stream_json``; ignored under ``capture`` (which already
    keeps everything).
