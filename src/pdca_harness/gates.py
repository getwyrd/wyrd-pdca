"""Deterministic Check gates → ``check-gates.json`` (docs 02 / 04, the gates path).

The gates are the *only* blocking path in Check — no model in the gating loop.
**Single-sourcing** (docs 04 §Single-sourcing) is the load-bearing property: the
gate *commands* live once in ``pdca.toml`` ``[[gates.checks]]``, and the same
``pdca gates`` entry point runs them for the local driver (over a bundle) and for
CI (over the PR working tree). There is no second implementation to drift.

Each configured check: ``{id, tier, label, cmd, gating, scope, target?}`` where
``scope`` is ``"repo"`` (runs against the working tree — what CI re-runs) or
``"bundle"`` (needs the bundle/patch context — local only), and the optional
``target`` (a project label or list of labels, e.g. ``"core"`` / ``["addon",
"frontend"]``) runs the check only when those labels are a SUBSET of the bundle's
label set (subset = AND). The bundle is classified from its brief: a primary axis
(``[gates] target_default`` + ``[gates.target_match]``) plus additive flags
(``[gates.target_flags]``); unset ⇒ no filtering. A check passes iff its ``cmd``
exits 0, fails on any other exit, and may instead declare itself **unverifiable**
when it genuinely cannot run its mechanical check (issue #46): exit
:data:`UNVERIFIABLE_RC` (77, the automake SKIP convention) **or** *declare* it by printing
a line that STARTS with :data:`UNVERIFIABLE_MARKER` (``PDCA-UNVERIFIABLE: <reason>``;
leading whitespace ignored) **while exiting 0 or 77** — the marker lets a gate that did NOT
fail defer to the human. It counts only on a non-failing exit, because a gate that failed
has failed whatever it printed (#329), and only at the start of a line, because a mid-line
occurrence is text the gate merely RELAYED (a child's log line, a quoted source comment),
not a verdict the gate declared (#428). When
``[[gates.checks]]`` is empty the driver falls back to all-PASS stub rows, so the
offline vertical slice still runs.

The row's **evidence line** follows the same declaration rule (issue #402): a gate states
its verdict summary by printing a line that STARTS with :data:`EVIDENCE_MARKER`
(``PDCA-EVIDENCE: <summary>``), and that summary — the LAST such line, a gate's final word
— becomes the row's ``path_line`` whatever the command relays afterwards. Without a
declaration the evidence falls back to the command's last output line, which is only ever
the gate's verdict by luck: the capture is one merged stdout+stderr stream, so a wrapper
that shells out to a suite files whatever that suite's children happened to flush last
(a scratch ``/tmp`` path from a since-deleted sandbox is not a reconstructable basis). The
marker declares evidence only — it never changes a verdict; the exit code alone decides
pass/fail, and only the ``PDCA-UNVERIFIABLE``/``PDCA-DEFERRED`` declarations can change
a ``result``.

A row: {check, result, oracle, rule_id, path_line, gating}. A row produced by a
bundle-scoped :func:`run_gates` additionally carries ``log`` (the bundle-relative path of
its full-output evidence log, ``gate-logs/<rule_id>.log``) and ``duration_secs`` (issue
#370) — additive keys, existing consumers unchanged. When that evidence log could NOT be
written, the row instead carries ``log_error`` (the reason) so a persistence failure is
never silent — the verdict itself is unaffected either way. ``result`` ∈
``pass`` / ``fail`` / ``unverifiable`` / ``deferred`` / ``none``. A ``none`` row is a
judgment cell decided by the reviewer + human (docs 04 §judgment cell); it is listed for
matrix alignment and never gates. An ``unverifiable`` row does **not** count toward
``overall`` (it is not a failure); the driver routes it into SUMMARY §6 NEEDS-HUMAN,
where the C6 accept-guard forces the human to clear it before sign-off.

A **``deferred``** row (issue #401) is the fourth member: the gate RAN and found its
subject **absent by design**, because the artifacts it audits are drafted later — the
Check-time run of a bundle-scoped T4 contribution row, whose ``commit-msg.txt`` /
``pr-description.md`` do not exist until publish. It is declared the same way
``unverifiable`` is — a line the gate STARTS with :data:`DEFERRED_MARKER`
(``PDCA-DEFERRED: <reason>``) while exiting 0 — and, like ``unverifiable``, it does not
count toward ``overall``. Unlike ``unverifiable`` it is **not** lifted into SUMMARY §6:
the condition is by-design and its substantive verdict is owed to a later gate, so a §6
checkbox on every cycle trains the human to tick §6 unread — the guard C6 depends on.
The deferral is honoured only for a row that is genuinely **re-gated later**
(:func:`_deferrable` → ``publish.publish_gates``); a row nothing re-runs has no later
verdict to defer to and keeps its pass/fail.

    """Map a gate command's exit code + output to (result, evidence-lines).

    ``unverifiable`` (issue #46) lets a gate that did NOT fail defer to the human: it may
    exit 0 and still declare the marker. The text after the marker is the reason; otherwise
    the evidence is the gate's declared summary, and failing that the command's last output
    line (as for pass/fail).

    The evidence line obeys the same declaration rule as the verdict (#402): the row records
    what the gate declared with :data:`EVIDENCE_MARKER`, and only where it declared nothing
    does it fall back to ``output``'s last line. That fallback is what made a GREEN gate's
    frozen record read like a failure path: the capture is one merged stdout+stderr stream
    (``progress.run_with_heartbeat``), so a wrapper that shells out to a test suite files
    whatever that suite's children flushed last — a ``/tmp`` scratch path from a sandbox
    that no longer exists was recorded as a passing C4's whole evidence, which is neither
    the *basis* of the verdict nor *reconstructable* (the invariant :func:`_write_gate_log`
    exists to keep, #370). Declaring is the only way a gate can be sure what gets filed, so
    the marker is the convention gate authors write to (docs 04 §Gate result vocabulary);
    the undeclared fallback stays defined, and the full basis stays in ``row["log"]``.
    The evidence marker never changes the verdict — a declaring gate that exits non-zero
    still FAILS, with its declaration as the evidence.

    The marker is honoured only for an exit code that is not a failure — 0, or the dedicated
    ``UNVERIFIABLE_RC``. A gate that exits non-zero FAILED, whatever its output happens to
    contain, and saying otherwise masked real red (#329): the marker is a plain substring, so
    a suite where one check deferred and a *different* test failed carried both the marker and
    a non-zero exit, and the whole gate read ``unverifiable`` — which is not a gating failure,
    so ``_finalize`` reported ``overall = "pass"``. Per bundle that still stops for a human
    (``assemble._unverifiable_items`` → §6 → C6), but three consumers read ``overall`` with no
    §6 in the path: the between-waves integration re-gate (``flow``) would not stop and later
    waves would build on a red tip, ``revalidate`` would not count it as a PASS→FAIL
    regression, and ``cli`` would exit 0. A gate with no possible verdict has its own channel;
    it must use it rather than piggy-backing on a failure.

    The same reason narrows *whose* marker counts (#428, the exit-0 half of #329). The
    verdict is the GATE's to declare, so only a line the gate started with the marker is one
    (:func:`_declared_unverifiable`); an occurrence anywhere else on a line is text the gate
    **relayed** from what it ran — a child's log, an assertion diff, a source comment a test
    read back — and it used to convert the gate's real verdict. It is structural for any project
    whose tests exercise this machinery: a green C4 whose captured output quoted the
    documented contract line (``... Emit `PDCA-UNVERIFIABLE: <reason>` and exit 77 ...``) was
    recorded ``unverifiable``, so a real green stopped counting toward ``overall`` and a real
    red would equally have been laundered into "defer to the human".

    ``deferred`` (issue #401) is the same family with a different addressee: the gate RAN,
    found its subject absent BY DESIGN, and owes its substantive verdict to a later gate —
    a bundle-scoped T4 contribution row at Check time, whose ``pr-description.md`` publish
    has not drafted yet. Recording that non-event as ``pass`` asserted a green no reviewer
    could reproduce (the artifacts the row names are not among its inputs), so every cycle
    escalated the by-design condition to §6 NEEDS-HUMAN; recording it ``unverifiable``
    would route it to §6 too. It is honoured only on exit **0** — 77 is the ``unverifiable``
    channel and a non-zero exit is a failure whatever the gate printed (#329) —
    ``unverifiable`` wins when both are declared (the safer channel: it stops for a human),
    and only when ``deferrable`` says a later gate actually re-runs this row
    (:func:`_deferrable`)."""
