"""Deterministic Check gates → ``check-gates.json`` (docs 02 / 04, the gates path).

The gates are the *only* blocking path in Check — no model in the gating loop.
**Single-sourcing** (docs 04 §Single-sourcing) is the load-bearing property: the
gate *commands* live once in ``pdca.toml`` ``[[gates.checks]]``, and the same
``pdca gates`` entry point runs them for the local driver (over a bundle) and for
CI (over the PR working tree). There is no second implementation to drift.

Each configured check: ``{id, tier, label, cmd, gating, scope, target?}`` where
``scope`` is ``"repo"`` (runs against the working tree — what CI re-runs) or
``"bundle"`` (needs the bundle/patch context — local only), and the optional
``target`` (a project label or list of labels, e.g. ``"core"`` / ``["addon",
"frontend"]``) runs the check only when those labels are a SUBSET of the bundle's
label set (subset = AND). The bundle is classified from its brief: a primary axis
(``[gates] target_default`` + ``[gates.target_match]``) plus additive flags
(``[gates.target_flags]``); unset ⇒ no filtering. A check passes iff its ``cmd``
exits 0, fails on any other exit, and may instead declare itself **unverifiable**
when it genuinely cannot run its mechanical check (issue #46): exit
:data:`UNVERIFIABLE_RC` (77, the automake SKIP convention) **or** print a line
containing :data:`UNVERIFIABLE_MARKER` (``PDCA-UNVERIFIABLE: <reason>``) **while exiting
0 or 77** — the marker lets a gate that did NOT fail defer to the human, and is ignored on
any other exit code, because a gate that failed has failed whatever it printed (#329). When
``[[gates.checks]]`` is empty the driver falls back to all-PASS stub rows, so the
offline vertical slice still runs.

A row: {check, result, oracle, rule_id, path_line, gating}. ``result`` ∈
``pass`` / ``fail`` / ``unverifiable`` / ``none``. A ``none`` row is a judgment cell
decided by the reviewer + human (docs 04 §judgment cell); it is listed for matrix
alignment and never gates. An ``unverifiable`` row does **not** count toward
``overall`` (it is not a failure); the driver routes it into SUMMARY §6 NEEDS-HUMAN,
where the C6 accept-guard forces the human to clear it before sign-off.
