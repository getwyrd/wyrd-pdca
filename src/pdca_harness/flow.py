"""The continuous orchestrator — Plan → Do → Check(gates → review → sign-off →
publish) → Act as one flow.

``flow`` drives a single issue; ``flow_batch`` handles the case where one Plan
session briefs several issues from the same documents: it plans them all, builds +
gates + reviews them all unattended, then walks the **cheap-first sign-off queue**
(:func:`queue.awaiting_signoff`) interactively, and runs Act once across the batch.

On an **accept** (the bundle reaches ``state.COMPLETE``) the flow runs **publish** —
the closing step of Check — which contributes the fix as a draft PR (``--no-publish``
to skip). When the leaves are stubbed (offline ``rehearse`` / CI) publish dry-runs, so
the continuous flow never pushes without a live model. Act is opt-in and runs last.

Control flow stays deterministic code: :mod:`driver` advances the state machine,
the gates gate, and the C6 accept-guard (in :func:`_signoff_and_apply`) governs
accept — models only fill leaf artifacts. Iteration is native (``iterate-do``
rebuilds; ``iterate-plan`` re-opens Plan) and bounded so a cycle can't spin forever.
