"""The continuous orchestrator — Plan → Do → Check(gates → review → sign-off →
publish) → Act as one flow.

``flow`` drives a single issue; ``flow_batch`` handles the case where one Plan
session briefs several issues from the same documents: it plans them all, builds +
gates + reviews them all unattended, then walks the **cheap-first sign-off queue**
(:func:`queue.awaiting_signoff`) interactively, and runs Act once across the batch.

On an **accept** (the bundle reaches ``state.COMPLETE``) the flow runs **publish** —
the closing step of Check — which contributes the fix as a draft PR (``--no-publish``
to skip). When the leaves are stubbed (offline ``rehearse`` / CI) publish dry-runs, so
the continuous flow never pushes without a live model. Act is opt-in and runs last.

Control flow stays deterministic code: :mod:`driver` advances the state machine,
the gates gate, and the C6 accept-guard (in :func:`_signoff_and_apply`) governs
accept — models only fill leaf artifacts. Iteration is native (``iterate-do``
rebuilds; ``iterate-plan`` re-opens Plan) and bounded so a cycle can't spin forever.

    its own drive path is exactly the asymmetry #468 removed. ``cli._flow`` calling this
    again is a regression a test pins (``test_flow_entrypoint_parity``).

    For the same reason this does **not** adopt the children of a split (#469): adoption
    lives once on the shared wave path (:func:`_drive_and_act`), which every CLI shape and
    ``flow_batch`` reach, and a second copy here — driving a bundle that is not in a
    ``wave_list`` and keeps no run-scoped budget — is precisely the divergence #468 removed
    and #449 spent five iterations chasing. A caller that wants a split driven wants
    ``flow_ids([id])``.

    ``max_iters`` defaults to ``cfg.max_passes`` (``[driver].max_passes``). Exhausting it
    with the bundle still iterating is NOT silent (issue #260) — the ``for``/``else`` names
    it with a resume hint. The ``break`` paths are the ordinary halts (COMPLETE, a human

    a prereq DISCONTINUED earlier never gets there, and its dependent is skipped loudly. A
    prerequisite **outside this batch** (a prior run's) is gated on its on-disk COMPLETE state
    (archived `completed/` too, #171) — **except** an out-of-batch ``Depends on (merged)``
    prereq, which keeps its stricter #107 merge-gate (#186): nothing in *this* run carries an
    out-of-batch prereq's diff into the base, and COMPLETE means only "a draft PR was opened",

# Split adoption (issue #469, mechanics from #449) — a bundle that reaches
# ``close-disposition = split`` WHILE THIS RUN IS DRIVING IT hands its children back to the
# run, instead of stranding them PLANNED for a hand-typed ``pdca flow <child-ids>``.
#
# Implemented ONCE, on the shared drive path (#468): ``cli._flow`` routes BOTH CLI shapes
# through :func:`flow_ids` → :func:`_drive_and_act`, and ``flow_batch``'s drive phase is
# that same call — so entry-point parity here is structural, not something two
# implementations have to be kept in step about (which is exactly what five iterations of
# #449 could not do).
#
# Adoption follows the LINEAGE EDGE, never the disk: a run adopts the children of the
# bundles IT IS DRIVING (transitively — an adopted child that splits in its turn is adopted
# in ITS wave), so the deliberate difference between ``flow_ids`` and the CSV resume sweep
# survives. It is bounded by ADOPTION, not by arithmetic (#473): a bundle already in the
# drive set is never adopted again, a candidate is examined at most once per splice, and
# every adopted child is a bundle already on disk — so each splice consumes a finite set and
# a chain of splits stops. The pass pool then funds every wave that chain produced
# (:func:`_pass_pool`) instead of truncating a schedule the run itself created.
#
# A bundle ALREADY terminal on a split when the run STARTS is the RECOVERY case (#473) — the
# children an earlier run (a crash, a ``^C``, a split accepted in another session) left
# PLANNED. ``flow_ids`` still SKIPS such an id, because a terminal bundle has nothing to
# build, and still prints :func:`_terminal_hint`'s non-destructive advice; what is new is
# that it hands the bundle on as an adoption SEED. The seed's children are spliced by this
# same code at ``k = -1`` ("the wave before wave 0"), under the same guards, the same
# reschedule and the same announcements a mid-run split gets — recovery is one more USE of
# the adoption path, never a second mechanism beside it.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Detect and validate in ONE step: a bundle that is not terminal on a ``split``
    (:func:`_is_split_parent`) has no adoptable children, so no caller can decide "is this a
    split" a second way.

    The ids come from the parent's ``split-lineage.json`` (:func:`split.read_lineage`,
    ``split.py:373``), read through the same tolerant :func:`_lineage_children` the terminal
    hint uses (``flow.py:679``) — a READ of a machine-readable record, never a parse of the
    prose breadcrumb ``accept`` leaves in ``build-notes.md`` (``split.py:627-634``), which
    is written for a human and is not a contract. A parent carrying the marker but no
    readable record is reported and skipped: that degrades to the operator's ``pdca flow
    <child-ids>``, never a crash and never a guess.

    EVERY entry is accounted for out loud, including the ones that never reach the loop:
    ``_lineage_children`` drops what it cannot format with (a non-string, an empty string)
    before this sees it, and a child dropped THERE would be stranded in silence — never
    adopted, never named, the operator left reading a sibling's ``unresolved dependency
    (601)`` as if 601 did not exist while a briefed bundle sits in the next directory. So what
    it refused is counted here from its own answer, never a second copy of its predicate.

    Each id is then filtered exactly as :func:`flow_ids` filters an explicitly named one: a
    bundle that does not exist or has no brief, and one already terminal, is named and
    dropped. An id LISTED TWICE yields one child, and an id that is not a plain tracker id
    (:data:`_PLAIN_ID`) or whose bundle is not really inside the bundle root
    (:func:`_inside_bundle_root`) is dropped as well — the record is a file an operator can
    hand-edit, and ``cfg.bundle`` would happily build a path outside the root (the hazard
    ``split.validate`` guards at write time, ``split.py:297-311``) or the same bundle twice
    (which would enter the wave computation, the drive set and the announcement twice over).

    "The same bundle" is decided on the RESOLVED directory, not the name alone, because two
    names can be one bundle: an ``issue_<id>`` symlinked to another inside the root passes
    :func:`_inside_bundle_root` by design, and adopting it beside the bundle it aliases puts
    one directory in one wave twice — under ``lanes > 1``, two lanes on one bundle.

    One skip is NOT reported here: a child already in ``known`` — this run's drive set plus
    what a sibling parent has just claimed — is appended to ``refused`` for the caller to
    report AFTER the splice (:func:`_report_refused`), with the name the run holds that
    DIRECTORY under (the child's own, except for an alias), since that is the name whose
    disposition the report looks up. What is true about such a child is not yet decided at
    this point in the run, and the eager line said the wrong one of the two.

    One dropped child is not a dead end (#473). A child that is terminal **on a split of its
    own** cannot be driven — but the generation below it can still be sitting where an
    earlier run left it (a 500 → 601 → 701 chain abandoned part-way down). Those come back
    as the SECOND return value, for the caller's queue, so the walk continues by re-entering
    this reader under that child's name — with these same guards, and its grandchildren
    attributed to the parent that actually declared them — rather than by a second reader of
    the same lineage record. It is a pair, not one list, because the two are different
    claims: the first is work this run takes on, the second is a bundle to ASK about.

    The announced wave is READ BACK from the recomputed schedule, never assumed to be the
    parent's index + 1: the children are levelled by their own ``Depends on`` /
    ``Conflicts with``, so two children of one parent routinely land in different waves and
    a hardcoded ``k + 1`` names a wave the second one is not in. A child the reschedule
    HELD is not announced as adopted at all, and never joins the results map —
    :func:`_report_held` has already named it as left in-flight.

    ``named`` is the set of bundles the run SET OUT to drive, and it is what makes that
    exclusion hold whenever the hold happens rather than only the first time. Each splice
    re-levels the WHOLE un-driven tail, so a child adopted into a later wave can be held by
    a LATER call — its prerequisite ended the run un-terminal, or its brief was re-planned
    onto one this run cannot resolve. Held is held: such a child is taken back out of
    ``bundles`` / ``batch_names`` and its adoption announcement RETRACTED on stderr, so the
    same situation ("this run created work it could not schedule") cannot produce two
    different report shapes — and two different exit codes — depending only on WHICH
    reschedule first saw it (``test_a_child_held_by_a_later_reschedule_leaves_the_run``).
    An id the operator NAMED is never dropped that way: the run owes an answer for every id
    it was given, so a held one stays in the map (``flow.py:1370-1379``,
    ``test_a_named_id_in_the_re_scheduled_tail_is_held_not_lost``).

    Adoption is bounded, and since #473 it is what bounds the RUN: a child already in the
    drive set is never re-adopted (``known``), a candidate leaves the queue once
    (``examined``), and every adopted child is a bundle already on disk — so each splice
    strictly consumes a finite set, and the schedule :func:`_pass_pool` funds cannot grow
    forever. (A child RETRACTED above is no longer in the set, so a later parent naming it
    may take it up again; each such round still needs a fresh split.) An adopted child that
    splits LATER, while this run drives it, is picked up by this same call in ITS wave — a
    recursion bound, not a recursion reset: nothing gives the run back what it has already
    spent, and no wave ever gets a second allowance. Either way the scope stays "the children
    of the bundles this run is driving, transitively" and never becomes a glob of
    ``results/``.

    ``known`` is ``batch_names | taken``, and it needs both halves: ``taken`` dedupes WITHIN
    one call — two parents that split in the SAME wave, the second's record also naming the
    first's child (``test_two_parents_splitting_in_one_wave_adopt_a_shared_child_once``) —
    while ``batch_names``, which this call grows, is the only thing that carries an adoption
    ACROSS calls, so a later wave's parent whose record names a child an earlier wave
    already adopted is skipped rather than scheduling, driving and announcing one bundle
    twice (``test_a_child_adopted_earlier_is_not_re_adopted_by_a_later_parent``).

    The two halves differ in one respect that is invisible in the dedup and load-bearing in
    the REPORT: ``batch_names`` is a schedule, ``taken`` is only a claim — the reschedule
    below can still hold that child. So a refusal is collected, not printed, and answered
    by :func:`_report_refused` once the splice has settled which of the two it was.

    Two things this deliberately does NOT do, both visible in a run and neither a
    consequence anyone should have to rediscover from the code:

    * A bundle that declared ``Depends on <parent>`` is levelled by its OWN edges, not
      re-pointed at the children the parent decomposed into — so it can share a wave with
      them. Its base is no worse than before adoption existed (a split parent closes with no
      patch either way), but the fold grouping is new. Re-pointing a dependent is a
      ``waves`` semantics change, deliberately out of this scope.
    * A child the reschedule HELD is excluded from the results map — on the call that
      adopts it, and equally on a later one that holds it again (it is dropped back out) —
      so a run whose only unfinished work is a held child still exits 0. That is the
      contract asked for: a held CHILD — work this run created, not work it was asked for —
      is not counted as work the run did (a held NAMED id stays in the map instead), and the
      hold itself is loud (:func:`_report_held`). But it does mean "this run created work it
      could not schedule" is reported on stderr rather than in the exit code.

    The shared body of both batch entry points. :func:`waves.compute_waves` orders the

    driven to sign-off, its accepted bundles published, and — in the default ``stack``
    mode — its cumulative accepted work folded onto a run-scoped integration branch
    (:func:`integrate.fold`) the **next** wave builds on. So a dependent builds on its
    prerequisite's accepted result within one run, as a reviewable PR stack the human
    merges (the harness never merges). Act runs **once** across the batch at the end.

    The drive set is no longer frozen (#469): a bundle that reaches
    ``close-disposition = split`` while this run is driving it hands its children back to
    the run, spliced into the waves after its own (:func:`_adopt_split_children`).
    ``adopt_seeds`` extends that to bundles the caller is NOT driving but wants examined for
    stranded children (#473) — an id the operator named whose bundle was ALREADY terminal on
    a split when the run started, which is how a run that stopped before its children were
    driven is recovered. They are spliced by the same call at ``k=-1``, so recovery is one
    more use of the adoption path rather than a second mechanism beside it.

    ``max_passes`` (``[driver].max_passes``) keeps its meaning — the allowance ONE wave gets
    — and sizes the run's **pool** at one allowance per wave the schedule holds, read LIVE so
    that a splice which grows it re-sizes it (:func:`_pass_pool`, #473). So a wave the run
    acquired mid-flight is funded like any other, and no bundle the run has SCHEDULED — an
    adopted child, or an id the operator typed that a splice pushed further back — is
    abandoned to arithmetic done before that wave existed. What bounds a chain of splits is
    that adoption itself is bounded; ``spent`` is never reset, and a wave still gets no more
    than one allowance. Running the pool out stops the run and names what it walked away
    from (#260's discipline).

    ``--no-publish`` (``do_publish=False``) drives every wave to COMPLETE but sequences
    nothing — no publish, no fold — so a later wave builds on the unchanged base.
