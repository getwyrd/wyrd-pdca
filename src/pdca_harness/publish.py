"""Publish — the **closing work of Check**: contribute an accepted fix as a draft PR.

Publishing is NOT a new PDCA beat. Check already owns the gates (including T4
contribution conformance) and the human sign-off; turning the accepted fix into a
draft pull request whose upstream CI the human weighs is the *contribution arm of
the same beat*. Once a bundle is accepted at sign-off (``state.COMPLETE``), this:

    contribution leaf → commit-msg.txt + pr-description.md     (the T4 gate's inputs)
    → T4 gate (must pass)
    → branch from upstream/<base> → git apply → commit → push → ``gh pr create --draft``
    → STOP.

STOP discipline: it never marks a PR ready or merges — that stays the human's
sign-off disposition. The mechanics are deterministic ``git``/``gh`` subprocesses
(no model decides control flow); the prose is written by the *publisher* leaf.

Project-specifics are config-driven (``pdca.toml``): the branch pattern
(``[publisher].fix_branch_pattern`` / ``feature_branch_pattern``) and the
repo→checkout map (``[publisher.checkouts]``, with the sibling convention as the
fallback). The issue trailer the T4 gate enforces is ``[tracker].issue_trailer``.

    leaves run from the shared project root, so a later bundle's leaf can touch an
    earlier bundle's artifacts — validation is therefore a separate pass the flow runs
    only after EVERY leaf has finished, so T4 always judges the final contents.

    ``draft=False`` is the flow's VALIDATION-ONLY phase (#295 review round 4): a
    missing artifact there means a later leaf DELETED it, and re-drafting would invoke
    the publisher leaf again mid-validation — reopening the exact shared-root mutation
    window the phase split closes (in a ≥3-bundle wave, the re-draft can mutate a
    bundle T4 already passed). Validation fails on missing files instead.

    Returns True when the phase succeeded — including the cases where there is
    legitimately nothing to draft (not COMPLETE, a close/no-fix empty patch, no usable

    silently made publish re-run it before every push. In one instance that check was a
    batched 3x model review of the whole ``patch.diff``: ~6 minutes, re-paid on every
    publish attempt and every retry — and the push and ``gh pr create`` sit downstream of
    it, so retries happen.

    Duplicated cost is the smaller half. **Publish re-samples a nondeterministic reviewer
    after the human has signed off**: a bundle green at Check can be refused at publish
    over a finding that did not exist when §9 was recorded. Observed in both directions on
    one bundle — two findings each seen by only 1 of 3 passes, and a re-run of the
    identical command minutes later reporting none. That is not re-checking a decision
    against a fixed oracle; it is drawing a fresh sample from a distribution, after the
    decision, with the branch push gated on the result.

    What the slot is actually for (this module's own docstring): checks whose subject is
    the contribution artifacts publish just drafted — ``commit-msg.txt`` /
    ``pr-description.md`` — which do not exist at Check time, so Check cannot have
    validated them.

    **The default is keyed on `scope`, not a flat True.** A bundle-scoped T4 row is about
    the bundle's own artifacts, so it defaults to running here — which keeps the shipped
    ``T4-contribution`` row gating publish, unchanged, including for an instance taking a
    ``copier update``. A repo-scoped row cannot be about artifacts publish just drafted, so
    it defaults off; a flat ``True`` would preserve the original defect for exactly those
    rows, and worse, publish's environment carries only ``$PDCA_BUNDLE`` (no
    ``$PDCA_WORKTREE``, which the Check runner exports), so a repo-scoped row depending on
    it passes Check and then falsely blocks the push.

    An explicit ``at_publish`` always wins, in both directions.

    Not modelled here, and worth knowing: a check cannot yet be publish-ONLY. ``_applies``
    knows only ``scope``/``target``, so a row whose subject is ``pr-description.md`` still
    runs at Check — where ``pdca contribcheck`` is deliberately default-open (no
    ``pr-description.md`` yet => pass), which is what lets one registration serve both
    phases. A real ``phase`` property would express it directly; that is the larger change
    #339 records for later.
