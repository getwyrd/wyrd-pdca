"""The driver — a thin, deterministic loop over a bundle's file-state (docs 03).

No model in the control path: ``state`` / ``advance`` / ``run_issue`` are pure
code, and the two model leaves are reached only inside :mod:`pdca_harness.leaves`.
The driver advances an issue beat by beat, writing each artifact, and STOPS at
AWAITING_SIGNOFF (the human touch point). The iterate transitions deliberately
**archive** the previous attempt into ``iteration-v<N>/`` (never delete it) so a
rebuild starts clean while the rejected attempt is preserved; on iterate-to-Plan
the ``brief.md`` is archived with it (state → UNPLANNED) for the re-authoring human.
