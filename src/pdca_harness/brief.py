"""Parsing the Plan artifact, ``brief.md`` (docs 02 §PLAN).

The brief is human-authored Markdown following ``templates/brief.md.tpl``. The
driver and the leaves need a few fields out of it (the test file path so iterate
can clear it; the spec fields so SUMMARY can be assembled). Parsing is
deliberately lenient: a field is read from a ``- **Label:** value`` or
``- Label: value`` bullet, case-insensitive on the label.

    * The value is **raw** — no ``_is_placeholder`` filtering. The renderer must keep showing an

      :func:`depends_on` parses an id list while ignoring trailing prose — all of them read a
