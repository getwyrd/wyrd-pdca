# reads identically to "the adversary never ran" — and an infra failure then presents as a
# clean adversarial pass. The status lets §6 say WHY the artifact is empty, and lets a
# consumer act on it (re-run vs adjudicate) instead of parsing prose.
# Both INFRA shapes mean "no review came back" (a transient one may have worked for minutes
# first), but they call for different ACTIONS, so the §6 row must not conflate them: a
# transient blip is safe to re-run as-is, while a leaf whose command could never be launched
# will fail identically until that command is fixed — telling the operator "safe to re-run"
# there would be a false instruction (PR #285 review).
# A third infra shape (issue #526): the leaf's command launched, but the vendor sandbox the
# harness seeded it with could not start on this host, so no command the leaf tried ever ran.
# Its action differs from both others — neither a re-run nor a config fix helps until the HOST
# can start that sandbox — so it gets its own marker rather than borrowing one's instruction.
#
# The marker only ever explains WHY an artifact is a placeholder. What decides WHETHER it is
# one is the completion trailer below (#541) — a positive stamp at a fixed position, so an
# artifact's classification turns on who closed it, never on what its text happens to mention.
# The table of statuses is therefore CLOSED, at the four below: a shape needing more detail
# than a token carries — the un-owned artifact of #541, whose leaf ran and exited 0 while
# nothing at its artifact path could be attributed to it — reuses `human-empty` (true of it: no
# usable verdict reached the bundle) and states its specifics in the placeholder's own prose,
# which is where a human reads them. Rounds 2–4 of #541 each patched the marker instead —
# labelling unknown tokens, an 8-line header window, a fourth token — and each re-opened the
# same hole, the last by self-triggering on any artifact that quoted its new token. Grow this
# table only for a MACHINE consumer that provably has to act on the difference — as

    Three kinds. IMPL — a rebuild can address it. STANDING — the reviewer's `Validation` row,
    which its prompt emits NEEDS-HUMAN on every cycle whatever it finds, so its presence proves
    nothing (#293). HUMAN — everything else.

    ``standing`` is decided by the CALLER and defaults off. It is true only for the canonical
    5/5/1 verdict row of the PRIMARY review, identified by an exact match on its Item cell
    (:func:`_needs_human`). This function does not re-derive it from the text, deliberately: a
    prefix test on the text is what let a real objection wear the template's clothes, and two
    sources of truth for "is this the constant row" is what produced that bug (PR #294 review).

    Fail safe throughout: an item we cannot map to a gate element — an unmarked advisory bullet,
    a reviewer row whose Item cell doesn't start with a canonical id, the missing-review
    placeholder — is HUMAN. Auto-iterate only ever fires on findings we positively know a
    rebuild can address, and neither HUMAN nor STANDING is one of them: neither ever *causes*
    a rebuild. Beside an IMPL item, a HUMAN finding is deferred to the handover §6 (#409);
    STANDING is not even deferred, since every Check re-emits it — and neither is a
    ``no_verdict`` row (:class:`NeedsHumanItem`), for the same reason.

    The finding's own builder-fixability statement (#408) is honoured AFTER the STANDING check,
    so a tag can never lift the constant V row. ``verdict_impl`` is the reviewer's
    `NEEDS-HUMAN [impl]` Verdict cell on a verdict table row, decided by the caller; it
    promotes the row only on a `_PROMOTABLE_ELEMENTS` cell (C5/T5). A leading `[impl]` in the
    text is weighed by ``tags`` (see `TAGS_FREE`): free for a Check advisory bullet, bounded
    to C5/T5 for the primary review, ignored for a plan advisory. A tag that is not honoured
    is dropped and the item classifies as if untagged. A leading `[human]` is stripped and
    the item is HUMAN.

    ``verdict_other`` is a verdict table row whose Verdict cell holds some other verdict
    (PASS / FAIL / N/A) while another of its cells mentions NEEDS-HUMAN, decided by the
    caller. The row contradicts itself, so it is HUMAN whatever its element: it still reaches
    the human, and never buys a rebuild — not even on a gate cell (#408 sign-off).
