"""Auto-merge mode for wave sequencing (#wave-model, opt-in) — merge each wave's PRs so
the next wave builds on the genuinely-merged base.

The **default** sequencing folds accepted work onto an integration branch without merging
(fork-safe, STOP discipline intact — see :mod:`integrate`). For an own-repo /
continuous-delivery target where "landed in the base" is the deliverable *and* the operator
has merge rights on ``base_remote``, ``[driver].wave_mode = "merge"`` instead merges each
non-final wave's PRs (``gh pr merge``) and fetches the base, so the next wave's Do worktree
(which resets to ``<base_remote>/<base>``) builds on the merged result.

Fail-closed: a PR that does not merge — a conflict, a failing required check, no merge
rights — returns non-zero so the caller STOPs; the next wave must never build on an
unmerged base. Idempotent (a resumed run skips an already-merged PR). Merging is
deterministic ``git``/``gh`` (no model); dry-run (stubbed publisher) prints the plan and
merges nothing. The harness's own ``gh pr merge`` runs in the orchestrator, outside the
``builder_guard`` hook that blocks the model leaves from merging — exactly as publish's
``gh pr create`` does.
