# Wyrd PDCA

PDCA quality-cycle wrapping Wyrd's cargo xtask gates

One command takes an issue from a brief all the way to a human-signed-off, verified
change — `Plan → Do → Check → sign-off → Act` — pausing only where a human belongs.

The driver is deterministic (state machine + gates + the C6 accept-guard are plain
code); a model is invoked only at the five **leaves**. See
[PCDA/quality-cycle.md](PCDA/quality-cycle.md) for the model and
[docs/INTEGRATION.md](docs/INTEGRATION.md) for this project's concretizations.

## Prerequisites

- The **Claude CLI** (`claude`) installed and authenticated (for a live `flow`).
- Python 3.11+ (stdlib only; no install needed — the `Makefile` runs from source).
- Whatever tools your gates need (see `pdca.toml` `[[gates.checks]]`).

## Quick start

```bash
make rehearse ID=123    # offline dry-run: PLANNED → … → COMPLETE on stub leaves
make setup              # ONCE: grant Claude read of the workspace
make flow ID=123        # run the whole cycle for issue 123 (live)
```

Run `make flow` **in a real terminal** — the Plan, sign-off, publish and Act steps
open Claude interactively. **Trust:** the first interactive session asks once to
*trust* the project — a one-time **global** setting (`~/.claude.json`), not something
`make setup` can write (`setup` handles file *permissions*). Accept it.

What happens, step by step (the cycle has four beats; review/sign-off/publish are
steps *within* Check):

1. **Plan** (interactive) — Claude reads your input documents (e.g. a tracker CSV
   via `CSV=…`) and, with you, writes `results/issue_<id>/brief.md`.
2. **Do** (headless) — Claude implements the brief: `patch.diff`, the test, `build-notes.md`.
3. **Check** — the deterministic gates run (`→ … still working` heartbeats while
   they do), then a headless advisory reviewer.
4. **Sign-off** (Check step, interactive) — Claude reviews the result *with* you; you
   clear the §6 items and decide `accept` / `iterate-do` / `iterate-plan`. The driver
   records §9 under the C6 guard.
5. **Publish** (Check step, interactive, on accept) — Claude drafts the contribution
   artifacts (commit-msg + PR description) and the driver opens a **draft PR** — the
   closing work of Check. `NO_PUBLISH=1` skips it; offline `rehearse` dry-runs it.
6. **Act** (interactive, only with `--act` / `ACT=1`) — Claude reviews the frozen
   cycle and suggests process improvements if any are warranted.

When a Plan/sign-off/publish session ends, exit Claude (**Ctrl-D**) to let the flow continue.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make setup` | One-time: write the permission config so the interactive leaves don't prompt. |
| `make flow ID=<id> [CSV="<path>"] [NO_PUBLISH=1] [ACT=1] [BY=<name>]` | Run the full cycle for one issue. On an accept it opens a draft PR (`NO_PUBLISH=1` stops at COMPLETE); `ACT=1` runs Act; `BY` overrides §9 attribution. |
| `make flow CSV="<path>"` | **Batch**: one Plan session may brief several issues; they all build unattended, then you sign off the cheap-first queue. |
| `make batch IDS="<id> …" [NOACT=1] [BY=<name>]` | Drive **already-briefed** bundles by id through the full cycle, no Plan beat (Do → Check → sign-off → publish → Act). `NOACT=1` stops after sign-off; `BY` overrides §9 attribution. Resumable. |
| `make publish ID=<id> [DRY=1]` | Re-publish an accepted bundle as a draft PR (the flow does this on accept). `DRY=1` prints the git/gh plan without pushing. |
| `make rehearse ID=<id> [CSV="<path>"]` | Dry-run the *same* control flow with stub leaves + stub gates — **no Claude, no live gates, instant** (publish dry-runs too). |
| `make status` | List every bundle and its state. |
| `make cli ARGS="<subcommand>"` | Any other `pdca` subcommand (e.g. `signoff 123 --accept`). |
| `make` / `make check` | Self-test (full / fast offline). |
| `make install` | Optional: a real `pdca` console script in `.venv/`. |

If something looks stuck, it isn't — a headless `claude -p` and a long gate print
nothing until they finish, so the flow shows a `… still working (NmSSs elapsed)`
heartbeat. Let it run.

## Gates (what makes a change "verified")

Configured in [pdca.toml](pdca.toml) `[[gates.checks]]`, single-sourced for the
local driver and CI (`pdca gates` / `pdca gates --working-tree`). Until you add real
rows the driver uses an all-PASS stub fallback — fill the gates first (see
[docs/INTEGRATION.md](docs/INTEGRATION.md) §4). Guidance learned the hard way:

- The **per-fix** correctness gate (apply the bundle's `patch.diff`, run *only* its
  test, assert red-without / green-with) is what makes a cycle mean something — make
  it `gating = true`, `scope = "bundle"`.
- A **whole-suite** runtime gate on the unmodified tree can't gate a single fix (a
  pre-existing failure makes it red regardless) — ship it `gating = false`
  (advisory) until the suite is green-baseline.

## Brief vs. design proposal

The planner picks the Plan template with you: ordinary fixes *and* most new
functionality use [templates/brief.md.tpl](templates/brief.md.tpl); a change big
enough to warrant a design proposal uses
[templates/design-proposal.md.tpl](templates/design-proposal.md.tpl). Not every
feature is a design proposal — it's the exception, authored at Plan.

## Layout

```
src/pdca_harness/   the deterministic driver (state machine, gates, leaves, flow)
engine/             your verification engine — the gate runners gates invoke (you fill in)
templates/          brief / design-proposal / SUMMARY templates
results/issue_<id>/  one bundle per issue — the state IS the files here
pdca.toml           project config: leaves, gates, tracker, paths
docs/INTEGRATION.md this project's concretizations
PCDA/               the generic model (reference docs)
.claude/agents/     the five leaf agents (planner, builder, reviewer, signoff, act)
```

## Notes

- **Iteration is built in.** `iterate-do` rebuilds against the same brief;
  `iterate-plan` re-opens Plan. The flow loops until `COMPLETE` (bounded).
- **Nothing is pushed for you.** The builder may open a *draft* PR for CI but can
  never mark it ready/merge — enforced by `.claude/hooks/builder_guard.py`.
- **Rendered from a template.** This project was generated from a Copier PDCA
  template; run `copier update` to pull upstream harness improvements.
